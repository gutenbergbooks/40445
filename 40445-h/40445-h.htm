<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Marshall's great Constitutional opinions grew out
of, or were addressed to, serious public conditions,
national in extent. In these volumes the effort is
made to relate the circumstances that required him
to give to the country those marvelous state papers:
for Marshall's opinions were nothing less than state
papers and of the first rank. In order to understand
the full meaning of his deliverances and to
estimate the just value of his labors, it is necessary
to know the historical sources of his foremost expositions
of the Constitution, and the historical purposes
they were intended to accomplish. Without
such knowledge, Marshall's finest pronouncements
become mere legal utterances, important, to be
sure, but colorless and unattractive.</p>

<p>It is worthy of repetition, even in a preface, that
the history of the times is a part of his greatest
opinions; and that, in the treatment of them a r&eacute;sum&eacute;
of the events that produced them must be given.
For example, the decision of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison,
at the time and in the manner it was rendered, was
compelled by the political situation then existing,
unless the principle of judicial supremacy over legislation
was to be abandoned. The Judiciary Debate
of 1802 in Congress&mdash;one of the most brilliant as
well as most important legislative engagements in
parliamentary history&mdash;can no more be overlooked
by the student of American Constitutional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>development, than the opinion of Marshall in Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison can be disregarded.</p>

<p>Again, in Cohens <i>vs.</i> Virginia, the Chief Justice
rises to heights of exalted&mdash;almost emotional&mdash;eloquence.
Yet the case itself was hardly more than a
police court controversy. If the trivial fine of itinerant
peddlars of lottery tickets were alone involved,
Marshall's splendid passages become unnecessary
and, indeed, pompous rhetoric. But when the curtains
of history are raised, we see the heroic part
that Marshall played and realize the meaning of his
powerful language. While Marshall's opinion in
M'Culloch <i>vs.</i> Maryland, even taken by itself, is a
major treatise on constitutional government, it becomes
a fascinating chapter in an engaging story,
when read in connection with an account of the
situation which compelled that outgiving.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of his other historic utterances.
Indeed, it may be said that his weightiest
opinions were interlocking parts of one great
drama.</p>

<p>Much space has been given to the conspiracy and
trials of Aaron Burr. The combined story of that adventure
and of those prosecutions has not hitherto
been told. In the conduct of the Burr trials, Marshall
appears in a more intimate and personal fashion
than in any other phase of his judicial career;
the entire series of events that make up that page
of our history is a striking example of the manipulation
of public opinion by astute politicians, and is,
therefore, useful for the self-guidance of American
democracy. Most important of all, the culminating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>result of this dramatic episode was the definitive
establishment of the American law of treason.</p>

<p>In narrating the work of a jurist, the temptation
is very strong to engage in legal discussion, and to
cite and comment upon the decisions of other courts
and the opinions of other judges. This, however,
would be the very negation of biography; nor would
it add anything of interest or enlightenment to the
reader. Such information and analysis are given
fully in the various books on Constitutional law and
history, in the annotated reports, and in the encyclop&aelig;dias
of law upon the shelves of every lawyer.
Care, therefore, has been taken to avoid making any
part of the <i>Life of John Marshall</i> a legal treatise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The manuscript of these volumes has been read by
Professor Edward Channing of Harvard; Professor
Max Farrand of Yale; Professor Edward S. Corwin
of Princeton; Professor William E. Dodd of Chicago
University; Professor Clarence W. Alvord of the
University of Illinois; Professor James A. Woodburn
of Indiana University; Professor Charles H.
Ambler of the University of West Virginia; Professor
Archibald Henderson of the University of North
Carolina; Professor D. R. Anderson of Richmond
(Va.) College; and Dr. H. J. Eckenrode of Richmond,
Virginia.</p>

<p>The manuscript of the third volume has been
read by Professor Charles A. Beard of New York;
Dr. Samuel Eliot Morison of Harvard; and Mr.
Harold J. Laski of Harvard. The manuscript of both
the third and fourth volumes has been read, from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>the lawyer's point of view, by Mr. Arthur Lord of
Boston, President of the Massachusetts Bar Association,
and by Mr. Charles Martindale of Indianapolis.</p>

<p>The chapters on the Burr conspiracy and trials
have been read by Professor Walter Flavius McCaleb
of New York; Professor Isaac Joslin Cox of the University
of Cincinnati; and Mr. Samuel H. Wandell
of New York. Chapter Three of Volume Three (Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison) has been read by the Honorable
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States; by the Honorable
Philander Chase Knox, United States Senator;
and by Mr. James M. Beck of New York. Other
special chapters have been read by the Honorable
Henry Cabot Lodge, United States Senator; by
Professor J. Franklin Jameson of the Department
of Historical Research of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington; by Professor Charles H. Haskins of
Harvard; by Dr. William Draper Lewis of Philadelphia,
former Dean of the Law School of the University
of Pennsylvania; and by Mr. W. B. Bryan of
Washington.</p>

<p>All of these gentlemen have made valuable suggestions
of which I have availed myself, and I gratefully
acknowledge my indebtedness to them. The responsibility
for everything in these volumes, however, is,
of course, exclusively mine; and, in stating my appreciation
of the comment and criticism with which
I have been favored, I do not wish to be relieved of
my burden by allowing the inference that any part
of it should be assigned to others.</p>

<p>I also owe it to myself again to express my heavy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>obligation to Mr. Worthington Chauncey Ford,
Editor of the Massachusetts Historical Society.
As was the case in the preparation of the first two
volumes of this work, Mr. Ford has extended to me
the resources of his ripe scholarship; while his wise
counsel, steady encouragement, and unselfish assistance,
have been invaluable in the prosecution of
a long and exacting task.</p>

<p>I also again acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr.
Lindsay Swift, Editor of the Boston Public Library,
who has read with critical care not only the many
drafts of the manuscript, but also the proofs of the
entire work. Mr. Swift has given, unstintedly, his
rare literary taste and critical accomplishment to the
examination of these pages.</p>

<p>I also tender my hearty thanks to Dr. Gardner
Weld Allen of Boston, who has generously directed
the preparation of the bibliography and personally
revised it.</p>

<p>Mr. David Maydole Matteson of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, has made the index of these volumes
as he made that of the first two volumes, and has
combined both indexes into one. In rendering this
service, Mr. Matteson has also searched for points
where text and notes could be made more accurate;
and I wish to express my appreciation of his kindness.</p>

<p>My thanks are also owing to the staff of The Riverside
Press, and particularly to Mr. Lanius D. Evans,
to whose keen interest and watchful care in the production
of this work I am indebted for much of
whatever exactitude it may possess.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>
<p>The manuscript sources have been acknowledged,
in all instances, in the footnotes where references
to them have been made, except in the case of the
letters of Marshall to his relatives, for which I again
thank those descendants and connections of the
Chief Justice named in the preface to Volumes One
and Two. The Hopkinson manuscripts are in the
possession of Mr. Edward Hopkinson of Philadelphia,
to whom I am indebted for the privilege of
inspecting this valuable source and for furnishing
me with copies of important letters.</p>

<p>In preparing these volumes, Mr. A. P. C. Griffin,
Assistant Librarian, and Mr. John Clement Fitzpatrick,
of the Manuscript Division of the Library
of Congress, have been even more obliging, if possible,
than they were in the preparation of the first
part of this work. The officers and their assistants
of the Boston Public Library, the Boston Athen&aelig;um,
the Massachusetts State Library, the Massachusetts
Historical Society, the Pennsylvania
Historical Society, the Virginia State Library, the
Indiana State Library, and the Indianapolis City
Library, have assisted whole-heartedly in the performance
of my labors; and I am glad of the opportunity
to thank all of them for their interest
and help.</p>

<h1>THE LIFE OF JOHN MARSHALL</h1>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>DEMOCRACY: JUDICIARY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rigorous law is often rigorous injustice. (Terence.)</p>

<p>The Federalists have retired into the Judiciary as a stronghold, and from
that battery all the works of republicanism are to be battered down.
(Jefferson.)</p>

<p>There will be neither justice nor stability in any system, if some material
parts of it are not independent of popular control. (George Cabot.)</p></div>

<p>A strange sight met the eye of the traveler who,
aboard one of the little river sailboats of the time,
reached the stretches of the sleepy Potomac separating
Alexandria and Georgetown. A wide swamp
extended inland from a modest hill on the east to a
still lower elevation of land about a mile to the west.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Between the river and morass a long flat tract bore
clumps of great trees, mostly tulip poplars, giving,
when seen from a distance, the appearance of "a
fine park."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Upon the hill stood a partly constructed white
stone building, mammoth in plan. The slight elevation
north of the wide slough was the site of an apparently
finished edifice of the same material, noble
in its dimensions and with beautiful, simple lines,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
but "surrounded with a rough rail fence 5 or 6 feet
high unfit for a decent barnyard."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
nothing could be seen beyond the groves near the
banks of the stream except the two great buildings
and the splendid trees which thickened into a
seemingly dense forest upon the higher ground to
the northward.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>On landing and making one's way through the underbrush
to the foot of the eastern hill, and up the
gullies that seamed its sides thick with trees and
tangled wild grapevines,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> one finally reached the
immense unfinished structure that attracted attention
from the river. Upon its walls laborers were
languidly at work.</p>

<p>Clustered around it were fifteen or sixteen wooden
houses. Seven or eight of these were boarding-houses,
each having as many as ten or a dozen rooms all
told. The others were little affairs of rough lumber,
some of them hardly better than shanties. One was
a tailor shop; in another a shoemaker plied his trade;
a third contained a printer with his hand press and
types, while a washerwoman occupied another; and
in the others there was a grocery shop, a pamphlets-and-stationery
shop, a little dry-goods shop, and an
oyster shop. No other human habitation of any kind
appeared for three quarters of a mile.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A broad and perfectly straight clearing had been
made across the swamp between the eastern hill and
the big white house more than a mile away to the
westward. In the middle of this long opening ran a
roadway, full of stumps, broken by deep mud holes
in the rainy season, and almost equally deep with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
dust when the days were dry. On either border was
a path or "walk" made firm at places by pieces of
stone; though even this "extended but a little way."
Alder bushes grew in the unused spaces of this thoroughfare,
and in the depressions stagnant water
stood in malarial pools, breeding myriads of mosquitoes.
A sluggish stream meandered across this
avenue and broadened into the marsh.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A few small houses, some of brick and some of
wood, stood on the edge of this long, broad embryo
street. Near the large stone building at its western
end were four or five structures of red brick, looking
much like ungainly warehouses. Farther westward
on the Potomac hills was a small but pretentious
town with its many capacious brick and stone residences,
some of them excellent in their architecture
and erected solidly by skilled workmen.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Other openings in the forest had been cut at various
places in the wide area east of the main highway
that connected the two principal structures already
described. Along these forest avenues were scattered
houses of various materials, some finished and some
in the process of erection.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Here and there unsightly
gravel pits and an occasional brick kiln added to the
raw unloveliness of the whole.</p>

<p>Such was the City of Washington, with Georgetown
near by, when Thomas Jefferson became President
and John Marshall Chief Justice of the United
States&mdash;the Capitol, Pennsylvania Avenue, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
"Executive Mansion" or "President's Palace," the
department buildings near it, the residences, shops,
hostelries, and streets. It was a picture of sprawling
aimlessness, confusion, inconvenience, and utter
discomfort.</p>

<p>When considering the events that took place in
the National Capital as narrated in these volumes,&mdash;the
debates in Congress, the proclamations of
Presidents, the opinions of judges, the intrigues of
politicians,&mdash;when witnessing the scenes in which
Marshall and Jefferson and Randolph and Burr and
Pinckney and Webster were actors, we must think
of Washington as a dismal place, where few and
unattractive houses were scattered along muddy
openings in the forests.</p>

<p>There was on paper a harmonious plan of a splendid
city, but the realization of that plan had scarcely
begun. As a situation for living, the Capital of the
new Nation was, declared Gallatin, a "hateful
place."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Most of the houses were "small miserable
huts" which, as Wolcott informed his wife, "present
an awful contrast to the public buildings."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Aside from an increase in the number of residences
and shops, the "Federal City" remained in this
state for many years. "The <i>Chuck</i> holes were not
<i>bad</i>," wrote Otis of a journey out of Washington in
1815; "that is to say they were none of them much
deeper than the Hubs of the hinder wheels. They
were however exceedingly frequent."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Pennsylvania<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Avenue was, at this time, merely a stretch of "yellow,
tenacious mud,"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or dust so deep and fine that,
when stirred by the wind, it made near-by objects
invisible.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And so this street remained for decades.
Long after the National Government was
removed to Washington, the carriage of a diplomat
became mired up to the axles in the sticky clay
within four blocks of the President's residence and
its occupant had to abandon the vehicle.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams records in his diary, April 4,
1818, that on returning from a dinner the street was
in such condition that "our carriage in coming for us
... was overset, the harness broken. We got home
with difficulty, twice being on the point of oversetting,
and at the Treasury Office corner we were both
obliged to get out ... in the mud.... It was a mercy
that we all got home with whole bones."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Fever and other malarial ills were universal at
certain seasons of the year.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "No one, from the
North or from the high country of the South, can
pass the months of August and September there
without intermittent or bilious fever," records King
in 1803.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Provisions were scarce and Alexandria,
across the river, was the principal source of supplies.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>

<p>Except a small Catholic chapel there was only
one church building in the entire city, and this tiny
wooden sanctuary was attended by a congregation
which seldom exceeded twenty persons.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This absence
of churches was entirely in keeping with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
inclination of people of fashion. The first Republican
administration came, testifies Winfield Scott, in
"the spring tide of infidelity.... At school and college,

religion as base superstition or gross hypocricy."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Most of the Senators and Representatives of the
early Congresses were crowded into the boarding-houses
adjacent to the Capitol, two and sometimes
more men sharing the same bedroom. At Conrad
and McMunn's boarding-house, where Gallatin lived
when he was in the House, and where Jefferson
boarded up to the time of his inauguration, the
charge was fifteen dollars a week, which included
service, "wood, candles and liquors."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Board at

such inn the new Chief Justice of the United States,
John Marshall, at first, found lodging.</p>

<p>Everybody ate at one long table. At Conrad and
McMunn's more than thirty men would sit down at
the same time, and Jefferson, who lived there while
he was Vice-President, had the coldest and lowest
place at the table; nor was a better seat offered him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
on the day when he took the oath of office as Chief

conveniences of life that a proposal was made in

to remove the Capital to Baltimore.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
An alternative suggestion was that the White House

erected for the Presidential residence.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>More than three thousand people drawn hither by
the establishment of the seat of government managed
to exist in "this desert city."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> One fifth of
these were negro slaves.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The population was made

adventurous, the curious, the restless,
the improvident. The "city" had more than the
usual proportion of the poor and vagrant who, "so
far as I can judge," said Wolcott, "live like fishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

</p>

<p>Yet some officials managed to distill pleasure from
materials which one would not expect to find in so
crude a situation. Champagne, it appears, was
plentiful. When Jefferson became President, that
connoisseur of liquid delights<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> took good care that
the "Executive Mansion" was well supplied with
the choicest brands of this and many other wines.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Senator Plumer testifies that, at one of Jefferson's
dinners, "the wine was the best I ever drank, particularly
the champagne which was indeed delicious."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
In fact, repasts where champagne was
served seem to have been a favorite source of enjoyment
and relaxation.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Scattered, unformed, uncouth as Washington was,
and unhappy and intolerable as were the conditions
of living there, the government of the city was
torn by warring interests. One would have thought
that the very difficulties of their situation would
have compelled some harmony of action to bring
about needed improvements. Instead of this, each
little section of the city fought for itself and was antagonistic
to the others. That part which lay near
the White House<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> strove exclusively for its own advantage.
The same was true of those who lived or
owned property about Capitol Hill. There was, too,
an "Alexandria interest" and a "Georgetown interest."
These were constantly quarreling and each
was irreconcilable with the other.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In all respects the Capital during the first decades
of the nineteenth century was a representation in
miniature of the embryo Nation itself. Physical conditions
throughout the country were practically the
same as at the time of the adoption of the Constitution;
and popular knowledge and habits of thought
had improved but slightly.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>A greater number of newspapers, however, had
profoundly affected public sentiment, and demo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>cratic
views and conduct had become riotously
dominant. The defeated and despairing Federalists
viewed the situation with anger and foreboding.
Of all Federalists John Marshall and George Cabot
were the calmest and wisest. Yet even they looked
with gloom upon the future. "There are some appearances
which surprize me," wrote Marshall on
the morning of Jefferson's inauguration to his intimate
friend, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.</p>

<p>"I wish, however, more than I hope that the public
prosperity &amp; happiness will sustain no diminution
under Democratic guidance. The Democrats are
divided into speculative theorists &amp; absolute terrorists.
With the latter I am disposed to class Mr. Jefferson.
If he ranges himself with them it is not difficult
to foresee that much difficulty is in store for our
country&mdash;if he does not, they will soon become his
enemies and calumniators."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>After Jefferson had been President for four
months, Cabot thus interpreted the Republican victory
of 1800: "We are doomed to suffer all the evils
of <i>excessive</i> democracy through the United States....
Maratists and Robespierrians everywhere raise their
heads.... There will be neither justice nor stability
in any system, if some material parts of it are
not independent of popular control"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>&mdash;an opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
which Marshall, speaking for the Supreme Court of
the Nation, was soon to announce.</p>

<p>Joseph Hale wrote to King that Jefferson's election
meant the triumph of "the wild principles of uproar
&amp; misrule" which would produce "anarchy."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Sedgwick advised our Minister at London: "The
aristocracy of virtue is destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In the course
of a characteristic Federalist speech Theodore
Dwight exclaimed: "The great object of Jacobinism
is ... to force mankind back into a savage state....
We have a country governed by blockheads and
knaves; our wives and daughters are thrown into the
stews.... Can the imagination paint anything more
dreadful this side of hell."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The keen-eyed and thoughtful John Quincy
Adams was of the opinion that "the basis of it all is
democratic popularity.... There never was a system
of measures [Federalist] more completely and irrevocably
abandoned and rejected by the popular
voice.... Its restoration would be as absurd as to
undertake the resurrection of a carcass seven years in
its grave."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> A Federalist in the <i>Commercial Gazette</i>
of Boston,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> in an article entitled "Calm Reflections,"
mildly stated that "democracy teems with fanati<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>cism."
Democrats "love liberty ... and, like other
lovers, they try their utmost to debauch ... their
mistress."</p>

<p>There was among the people a sort of diffused egotism
which appears to have been the one characteristic
common to Americans of that period. The most
ignorant and degraded American felt himself far
superior to the most enlightened European. "Behold
the universe," wrote the chronicler of Congress
in 1802. "See its four quarters filled with savages or
slaves. Out of nine hundred millions of human beings
but four millions [Americans] are free."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>William Wirt describes the contrast of fact to pretension:
"Here and there a stately aristocratick
palace, with all its appurtenances, strikes the view:
while all around for many miles, no other buildings
are to be seen but the little smoky huts and log
cabins of poor, laborious, ignorant tenants. And
what is very ridiculous, these tenants, while they
approach <i>the great house</i>, cap in hand, with all the
fearful trembling submission of the lowest feudal
vassals, boast in their court-yards, with obstreperous
exultation, that they live in a land of freemen, a
land of equal liberty and equal rights."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Conservatives believed that the youthful Republic
was doomed; they could see only confusion, destruction,
and decline. Nor did any nation of the
Old World at that particular time present an example
of composure and constructive organization. All
Europe was in a state of strained suspense during the
interval of the artificial peace so soon to end. "I
consider the whole civilized world as metal thrown
back into the furnace to be melted over again,"
wrote Fisher Ames after the inevitable resumption
of the war between France and Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
"Tremendous times in Europe!" exclaimed Jefferson
when cannon again were thundering in every
country of the Old World. "How mighty this battle
of lions &amp; tygers! With what sensations should the
common herd of cattle look upon it? With no partialities,
certainly!"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson interpreted the black forebodings of the
defeated conservatives as those of men who had been
thwarted in the prosecution of evil designs: "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
clergy, who have missed their union with the State,
the Anglo men, who have missed their union with
England, the political adventurers who have lost the
chance of swindling &amp; plunder in the waste of public
money, will never cease to bawl, on the breaking up
of their sanctuary."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Of all the leading Federalists, John Marshall was
the only one who refused to "bawl," at least in the
public ear; and yet, as we have seen and shall again
find, he entertained the gloomy views of his political
associates. Also, he held more firmly than any prominent
man in America to the old-time Federalist
principle of Nationalism&mdash;a principle which with
despair he watched his party abandon.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> His whole
being was fixed immovably upon the maintenance
of order and constitutional authority. Except for his
letter to Pinckney, Marshall was silent amidst the
clamor. All that now went forward passed before
his regretful vision, and much of it he was making
ready to meet and overcome with the affirmative
opinions of constructive judicial statesmanship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he discharged his duties&mdash;then very
light&mdash;as Chief Justice. But in doing so, he quietly
began to strengthen the Supreme Court. He did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
this by one of those acts of audacity that later
marked the assumptions of power which rendered his
career historic. For the first time the Chief Justice
disregarded the custom of the delivery of opinions by
the Justices <i>seriatim</i>, and, instead, calmly assumed
the function of announcing, himself, the views of
that tribunal. Thus Marshall took the first step in
impressing the country with the unity of the highest
court of the Nation. He began this practice in
Talbot <i>vs</i>. Seeman, familiarly known as the case of
the Amelia,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the first decided by the Supreme Court
after he became Chief Justice.</p>

<p>During our naval war with France an armed
merchant ship, the Amelia, owned by one Chapeau
Rouge of Hamburg, while homeward bound from
Calcutta, was taken by the French corvette, La
Diligente. The Amelia's papers, officers, and crew
were removed to the French vessel, a French crew
placed in charge, and the captured ship was sent to
St. Domingo as a prize. On the way to that French
port, she was recaptured by the American frigate,
Constitution, Captain Silas Talbot, and ordered to
New York for adjudication. The owner demanded
ship and cargo without payment of the salvage
claimed by Talbot for his rescue. The case finally
reached the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In the course of a long and careful opinion the
Chief Justice held that, although there had been no
formal declaration of war on France, yet particular
acts of Congress had authorized American warships
to capture certain French vessels and had provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
for the payment of salvage to the captors. Virtually,
then, we were at war with France. While the Amelia
was not a French craft, she was, when captured
by Captain Talbot, "an armed vessel commanded
and manned by Frenchmen," and there was "probable
cause to believe" that she was French. So her
capture was lawful.</p>

<p>Still, the Amelia was not, in fact, a French vessel,
but the property of a neutral; and in taking her
from the French, Talbot had, in reality, rescued the
ship and rendered a benefit to her owners for which
he was entitled to salvage. For a decree of the
French Republic made it "extremely probable"
that the Amelia would be condemned by the French
courts in St. Domingo; and that decree, having been
"promulgated" by the American Government,
must be considered by American courts "as an
authenticated copy of a public law of France interesting
to all nations." This, said Marshall, was "the
real and only question in the case." The first opinion
delivered by Marshall as Chief Justice announced,
therefore, an important rule of international law and
is of permanent value.</p>

<p>Marshall's next case<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> involved complicated questions
concerning lands in Kentucky. Like nearly all
of his opinions, the one in this case is of no historical
importance except that in it he announced for the
second time the views of the court. In United
States <i>vs</i>. Schooner Peggy,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Marshall declared that,
since the Constitution makes a treaty a "supreme
law of the land," courts are as much bound by it as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
by an act of Congress. This was the first time that
principle was stated by the Supreme Court. Another
case<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> concerned the law of practice and of
evidence. This was the last case in which Marshall
delivered an opinion before the Republican assault
on the Judiciary was made&mdash;the causes of which
assault we are now to examine.</p>

<p>At the time of his inauguration, Jefferson apparently
meant to carry out the bargain<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> by which his
election was made possible. "We are all Republicans,
we are all Federalists," were the reassuring
words with which he sought to quiet those who already
were beginning to regret that they had yielded
to his promises.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Even Marshall was almost favorably
impressed by the inaugural address. "I have
administered the oath to the Presdt.," he writes
Pinckney immediately after Jefferson had been inducted
into office. "His inauguration speech ... is in
general well judged and conciliatory. It is in direct
terms giving the lie to the violent party declamation
which has elected him, but it is strongly characteristic
of the general cast of this political theory."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>It is likely that, for the moment, the President
intended to keep faith with the Federalist leaders.
But the Republican multitude demanded the spoils
of victory; and the Republican leaders were not
slow or soft-spoken in telling their chieftain that he
must take those measures, the assurance of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
had captivated the popular heart and given "the
party of the people" a majority in both House and
Senate.</p>

<p>Thus the Republican programme of demolition
was begun. Federalist taxes were, of course, to
be abolished; the Federalist mint dismantled; the
Federalist army disbanded; the Federalist navy
beached. Above all, the Federalist system of National
courts was to be altered, the newly appointed
Federalist National judges ousted and their places
given to Republicans; and if this could not be accomplished,
at least the National Judiciary must be
humbled and cowed. Yet every step must be taken
with circumspection&mdash;the cautious politician at
the head of the Government would see to that. No
atom of party popularity<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> must be jeopardized;
on the contrary, Republican strength must be increased
at any cost, even at the temporary sacrifice
of principle.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Unless these facts are borne in mind,
the curious blending of fury and moderation&mdash;of
violent attack and sudden quiescence&mdash;in the Re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>publican
tactics during the first years of Jefferson's
Administration are inexplicable.</p>

<p>Jefferson determined to strike first at the National
Judiciary. He hated it more than any other of the
"abominations" of Federalism. It was the only
department of the Government not yet under his
control. His early distrust of executive authority,
his suspicion of legislative power when his political
opponents held it, were now combined against the
National courts which he did not control.</p>

<p>Impotent and little respected as the Supreme
Court had been and still was, Jefferson nevertheless
entertained an especial fear of it; and this feeling
had been made personal by the thwarting of his
cherished plan of appointing his lieutenant, Spencer
Roane of Virginia, Chief Justice of the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The elevation of his particular aversion,
John Marshall, to that office, had, he felt, wickedly
robbed him of the opportunity to make the new
regime harmonious; and, what was far worse, it had
placed in that station of potential, if as yet undeveloped,
power, one who, as Jefferson had finally
come to think, might make the high court of the
Nation a mighty force in the Government, retard
fundamental Republican reforms, and even bring to
naught measures dear to the Republican heart.</p>

<p>It seems probable that, at this time, Jefferson was
the only man who had taken Marshall's measure
correctly. His gentle manner, his friendliness and
conviviality, no longer concealed from Jefferson the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
courage and determination of his great relative; and
Jefferson doubtless saw that Marshall, with his universally
conceded ability, would find means to vitalize
the National Judiciary, and with his fearlessness,
would employ those means.</p>

<p>"The Federalists," wrote Jefferson, "have retired
into the judiciary as a stronghold ... and from that
battery all the works of republicanism are to be
beaten down and erased."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Therefore that stronghold
must be taken. Never was a military plan more
carefully devised than was the Republican method
of capturing it. Jefferson would forthwith remove
all Federalist United States marshals and attorneys;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
he would get rid of the National judges whom
Adams had appointed under the Judiciary Act of
1801.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> If this did not make those who remained on
the National Bench sufficiently tractable, the sword
of impeachment would be held over their obstinate
heads until terror of removal and disgrace should
render them pliable to the dominant political will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Thus by progressive stages the Supreme Court would
be brought beneath the blade of the executioner and
the obnoxious Marshall decapitated or compelled to
submit.</p>

<p>To this agreeable course, so well adapted to his
purposes, the President was hotly urged by the foremost
leaders of his party. Within two weeks after
Jefferson's inauguration, the able and determined
William Branch Giles of Virginia, faithfully interpreting
the general Republican sentiment, demanded
"the removal of all its [the Judiciary's] executive
officers indiscriminately." This would get rid of the
Federalist marshals and clerks of the National courts;
they had been and were, avowed Giles, "the humble
echoes" of the "vicious schemes" of the National
judges, who had been "the most unblushing violators
of constitutional restrictions."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Again Giles
expressed the will of his party: "The revolution
[Republican success in 1800] is incomplete so long as
that strong fortress [the Judiciary] is in possession
of the enemy." He therefore insisted upon "the
absolute repeal of the whole judiciary system."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The Federalist leaders quickly divined the first
part of the Republican purpose: "There is nothing
which the [Republican] party more anxiously wish
than the destruction of the judicial arrangements
made during the last session," wrote Sedgwick.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
And Hale, with dreary sarcasm, observed that "the
independence of our Judiciary is to be confirmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
by being made wholly subservient to the will of the
legislature &amp; the caprice of Executive visions."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The judges themselves had invited the attack so
soon to be made upon them.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Immediately after the
Government was established under the Constitution,
they took a position which disturbed a large part of
the general public, and also awakened apprehensions
in many serious minds. Persons were haled before
the National courts charged with offenses unknown
to the National statutes and unnamed in the Constitution;
nevertheless, the National judges held that
these were indictable and punishable under the common
law of England.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>This was a substantial assumption of power. The
Judiciary avowed its right to pick and choose among
the myriad of precedents which made up the common
law, and to enforce such of them as, in the opinion
of the National judges, ought to govern American
citizens. In a manner that touched directly the
lives and liberties of the people, therefore, the judges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
became law-givers as well as law-expounders. Not
without reason did the Republicans of Boston drink
with loud cheers this toast: "The Common Law of
England! May wholesome statutes soon root out
this engine of oppression from America."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The occasions that called forth this exercise of
judicial authority were the violation of Washington's
Neutrality Proclamation, the violation of the
Treaty of Peace with Great Britain, and the numberless
threats to disregard both. From a strictly legal
point of view, these indeed furnished the National
courts with plausible reasons for the position they
took. Certainly the judges were earnestly patriotic
and sincere in their belief that, although Congress
had not authorized it, nevertheless, that accumulation
of British decisions, usages, and customs called
"the common law" was a part of American National
jurisprudence; and that, of a surety, the assertion of
it in the National tribunals was indispensable to the
suppression of crimes against the United States. In
charging the National grand jury at Richmond, May
22, 1793, Chief Justice John Jay first announced this
doctrine, although not specifically naming the common
law.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Two months later, Justice James Wilson
claimed the same inclusive power in his address to
the grand jury at Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>In 1793, Joseph Ravara, consul for Genoa, was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>dicted
in the United States District Court of Pennsylvania
for sending an anonymous and threatening
letter to the British Minister and to other persons
in order to extort money from them. There was not
a word in any act of Congress that referred even indirectly
to such a misdemeanor, yet Justices Wilson
and Iredell of the Supreme Court, with Judge Peters
of the District Court, held that the court had jurisdiction,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
and at the trial Chief Justice Jay and District
Judge Peters held that the rash Genoese could
be tried and punished under the common law of
England.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Three months later Gideon Henfield was brought
to trial for the violation of the Neutrality Proclamation.
The accused, a sailor from Salem, Massachusetts,
had enlisted at Charleston, South Carolina, on
a French privateer and was given a commission as
an officer of the French Republic. As such he preyed
upon the vessels of the enemies of France. One
morning in May, 1793, Captain Henfield sailed into
the port of Philadelphia in charge of a British prize
captured by the French privateer which he commanded.</p>

<p>Upon demand of the British Minister, Henfield
was seized, indicted, and tried in the United States
Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In
the absence of any National legislation covering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
subject, Justice Wilson instructed the grand jury
that Henfield could, and should, be indicted and
punished under British precedents.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> When the case
was heard the charge of the court to the trial jury was
to the same effect.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The jury refused to convict.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The verdict was
"celebrated with extravagant marks of joy and exultation,"
records Marshall in his account of this memorable
trial. "It was universally asked," he says,
"what law had been offended, and under what statute
was the indictment supported? Were the American
people already prepared to give to a proclamation
the force of a legislative act, and to subject themselves
to the will of the executive? But if they were
already sunk to such a state of degradation, were
they to be punished for violating a proclamation
which had not been published when the offense was
committed, if indeed it could be termed an offense
to engage with France, combating for liberty against
the combined despots of Europe?"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In this wise, political passions were made to
strengthen the general protest against riveting the
common law of England upon the American people
by judicial fiat and without authorization by the
National Legislature.</p>

<p>Isaac Williams was indicted and tried in 1799, in
the United States Circuit Court for the District of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Connecticut, for violating our treaty with Great
Britain by serving as a French naval officer. Williams
proved that he had for years been a citizen of
France, having been "duly naturalized" in France,
"renouncing his allegiance to all other countries,
particularly to America, and taking an oath of allegiance
to the Republic of France." Although these
facts were admitted by counsel for the Government,
and although Congress had not passed any statute
covering such cases, Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth
practically instructed the jury that under the British
common law Williams must be found guilty.</p>

<p>No American could cease to be a citizen of his
own country and become a citizen or subject of another
country, he said, "without the consent ... of
the community."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The Chief Justice announced as
American law the doctrine then enforced by European
nations&mdash;"born a subject, always a subject."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
So the defendant was convicted and sentenced "to
pay a fine of a thousand dollars and to suffer four
months imprisonment."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>These are examples of the application by the National
courts of the common law of England in cases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
where Congress had failed or refused to act. Crime
must be punished, said the judges; if Congress would
not make the necessary laws, the courts would act
without statutory authority. Until 1812, when the
Supreme Court put an end to this doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the
National courts, with one exception,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> continued to
apply the common law to crimes and offenses which
Congress had refused to recognize as such, and for
which American statutes made no provision.</p>

<p>Practically all of the National and many of the
State judges were highly learned in the law, and, of
course, drew their inspiration from British precedents
and the British bench. Indeed, some of them
were more British than they were American.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> "Let
a stranger go into our courts," wrote Tyler, "and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
would almost believe himself in the Court of the
King's Bench."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>This conduct of the National Judiciary furnished
Jefferson with another of those "issues" of which
that astute politician knew how to make such effective
use. He quickly seized upon it, and with characteristic
fervency of phrase used it as a powerful
weapon against the Federalist Party. All the evil
things accomplished by that organization of "monocrats,"
"aristocrats," and "monarchists"&mdash;the
bank, the treaty, the Sedition Act, even the army
and the navy&mdash;"have been solitary, inconsequential,
timid things," avowed Jefferson, "in comparison
with the audacious, barefaced and sweeping pretension
to a system of law for the U.S. without the
adoption of their legislature, and so infinitely beyond
their power to adopt."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>But if the National judges had caused alarm by
treating the common law as though it were a statute
of the United States without waiting for an act of
Congress to make it so, their manners and methods
in the enforcement of the Sedition Act<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> aroused
against them an ever-increasing hostility.</p>

<p>Stories of their performances on the bench in such
cases&mdash;their tones when speaking to counsel, to
accused persons, and even to witnesses, their immoderate
language, their sympathy with one of the
European nations then at war and their animosity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
toward the other, their partisanship in cases on trial
before them&mdash;tales made up from such material
flew from mouth to mouth, until finally the very
name and sight of National judges became obnoxious
to most Americans. In short, the assaults upon the
National Judiciary were made possible chiefly by
the conduct of the National judges themselves.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The first man convicted under the Sedition Law
was a Representative in Congress, the notorious
Matthew Lyon of Vermont. He had charged President
Adams with a "continual grasp for power ...
an unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish
adulation and selfish avarice." Also, Lyon had
permitted the publication of a letter to him from
Joel Barlow, in which the President's address to the
Senate and the Senate's response<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> were referred
to as "the bullying speech of your President" and
"the stupid answer of your Senate"; and expressed
wonder "that the answer of both Houses had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
been an order to send him [Adams] to the mad
house."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Lyon was indicted under the accusation that he
had tried "to stir up sedition and to bring the President
and Government of the United States into contempt."
He declared that the jury was selected from
his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Under the charge of Justice Paterson
of the Supreme Court he was convicted. The court
sentenced him to four months in jail and the payment
of a fine of one thousand dollars.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>In the execution of the sentence, United States
Marshal Jabez G. Fitch used the prisoner cruelly.
On the way to the jail at Vergennes, Vermont, he
was repeatedly insulted. He was finally thrown into
a filthy, stench-filled cell without a fireplace and
with nothing "but the iron bars to keep the cold
out." It was "the common receptacle for horse-thieves
... runaway negroes, or any kind of felons."
He was subjected to the same kind of treatment that
was accorded in those days to the lowest criminals.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The people were deeply stirred by the fate of Matthew
Lyon. Quick to realize and respond to public
feeling, Jefferson wrote: "I know not which mortifies
me most, that I should fear to write what I think, or
my country bear such a state of things."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>One Anthony Haswell, editor of the <i>Vermont Ga<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>zette</i>
published at Bennington, printed an advertisement
of a lottery by which friends of Lyon, who was
a poor man, hoped to raise enough money to pay his
fine. This advertisement was addressed "to the enemies
of political persecutions in the western district
of Vermont." It was asserted that Lyon "is holden
by the oppressive hand of usurped power in a loathsome
prison, deprived almost of the right of reason,
and suffering all the indignities which can be heaped
upon him by a hard-hearted savage, who has, to the
disgrace of Federalism, been elevated to a station
where he can satiate his barbarity on the misery of
his victims."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The "savage" referred to was United
States Marshal Fitch. In the same paper an excerpt
was reprinted from the <i>Aurora</i> which declared that
"the administration publically notified that Tories
... were worthy of the confidence of the government."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Haswell was indicted for sedition. In defense he
established the brutality with which Lyon had been
treated and proposed to prove by two witnesses
not then present (General James Drake of Virginia,
and James McHenry, President Adams's Secretary
of War) that the Government favored the occasional
appointment of Tories to office. Justice Paterson
ruled that such evidence was inadmissible, and
charged the jury that if Haswell's intent was defamatory,
he should be found guilty. Thereupon
he was convicted and sentenced to two months'
imprisonment and the payment of a fine of two
hundred dollars.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Cooper, editor of the <i>Sunbury and
Northumberland Gazette</i> in Pennsylvania, in the
course of a political controversy declared in his
paper that when, in the beginning of Adams's Administration,
he had asked the President for an
office, Adams "was hardly in the infancy of political
mistake; even those who doubted his capacity
thought well of his intentions.... Nor were we yet
saddled with the expense of a permanent navy, or
threatened ... with the existence of a standing army....
Mr. Adams ... had not yet interfered ... to influence
the decisions of a court of justice."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>For this "attack" upon the President, Cooper was
indicted under the Sedition Law. Conducting his
own defense, he pointed out the issues that divided
the two great parties, and insisted upon the propriety
of such political criticism as that for which he
had been indicted.</p>

<p>Cooper was himself learned in the law,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and during
the trial he applied for a subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i> to compel
President Adams to attend as a witness, bringing
with him certain documents which Cooper alleged to
be necessary to his defense. In a rage Justice Samuel
Chase of the Supreme Court, before whom, with
Judge Richard Peters of the District Court, the case
was tried, refused to issue the writ. For this he was
denounced by the Republicans. In the trial of Aaron
Burr, Marshall was to issue this very writ to President
Thomas Jefferson and, for doing so, to be rebuked,
denounced, and abused by the very parti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>sans
who now assailed Justice Chase for refusing to
grant it.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Justice Chase charged the jury at intolerable
length: "If a man attempts to destroy the confidence
of the people in their officers ... he effectually saps the
foundation of the government." It was plain that
Cooper "intended to provoke" the Administration,
for had he not admitted that, although he did not
arraign the motives, he did mean "to censure the
conduct of the President"? The offending editor's
statement that "our credit is so low that we are
obliged to borrow money at 8 per cent. in time of
peace," especially irritated the Justice. "I cannot,"
he cried, "suppress my feelings at this gross attack
upon the President." Chase then told the jury that
the conduct of France had "rendered a loan necessary";
that undoubtedly Cooper had intended "to
mislead the ignorant ... and to influence their votes
on the next election."</p>

<p>So Cooper was convicted and sentenced "to pay
a fine of four hundred dollars, to be imprisoned for
six months, and at the end of that period to find
surety for his good behavior himself in a thousand,
and two sureties in five hundred dollars each."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>"Almost every other country" had been "convulsed
with ... war," desolated by "every species of
vice and disorder" which left innocence without
protection and encouraged "the basest crimes."
Only in America there was no "grievance to complain
of." Yet our Government had been "as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
grossly abused as if it had been guilty of the vilest
tyranny"&mdash;as if real "republicanism" could "only
be found in the happy soil of France" where "Liberty,
like the religion of Mahomet, is propagated by
the sword." In the "bosom" of that nation "a dagger
was concealed."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In these terms spoke James
Iredell, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
in addressing the grand jury for the District of
Pennsylvania. He was delivering the charge that
resulted in the indictment for treason of John
Fries and others who had resisted the Federalist
land tax.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The triumph of France had, of course, nothing
whatever to do with the forcible protest of the Pennsylvania
farmers against what they felt to be Federalist
extortion; nevertheless upon the charge of
Justice Iredell as to the law of treason, they were
indicted and convicted for that gravest of all offenses.
A new trial was granted because one of the
jury, John Rhoad, "had declared a prejudice against
the prisoner after he was summoned as a juror."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> On
April 29, 1800, the second trial was held. This time
Justice Chase presided. The facts were agreed to by
counsel. Before the jury had been sworn, Chase
threw on the table three papers in writing and announced
that these contained the opinion of the
judges upon the law of treason&mdash;one copy was for
the counsel for the Government, one for the defendant's
counsel, and one for the jury.</p>

<p>William Lewis, leading attorney for Fries, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the ablest members of the Philadelphia bar,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> was enraged.
He looked upon the paper, flung it from him,
declaring that "his hand never should be polluted
by a prejudicated opinion," and withdrew from the
case, although Chase tried to persuade him to "go
on in any manner he liked." Alexander J. Dallas,
the other counsel for Fries, also withdrew, and the
terrified prisoner was left to defend himself. The
court told him that the judges, personally, would see
that justice was done him. Again Fries and his accomplices
were convicted under the charge of the court.
"In an aweful and affecting manner"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Chase pronounced
the sentence, which was that the condemned
men should be "hanged by the neck <i>until dead</i>."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans furiously assailed this conviction
and sentence. President Adams pardoned Fries and
his associates, to the disgust and resentment of the
Federalist leaders.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> On both sides the entire proceeding
was made a political issue.</p>

<p>On the heels of this "repetition of outrage," as the
Republicans promptly labeled the condemnation of
Fries, trod the trial of James Thompson Callender
for sedition, over which it was again the fate of
the unlucky Chase to preside. <i>The Prospect Before
Us</i>, written by Callender under the encouragement
of Jefferson,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> contained a characteristically vicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
screed against Adams. His Administration had been
"a tempest of malignant passions"; his system had
been "a French war, an American navy, a large
standing army, an additional load of taxes." He
"was a professed aristocrat and he had proved faithful
and serviceable to the British interest" by sending
Marshall and his associates to France. In the
President's speech to Congress,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> "this hoary headed
incendiary ... bawls to arms! then to arms!"</p>

<p>Callender was indicted for libel under the Sedition
Law.</p>

<p>Before Judge Chase started for Virginia, Luther
Martin had given him a copy of Callender's pamphlet,
with the offensive passages underscored. During
a session of the National court at Annapolis,
Chase, in a "jocular conversation," had said that he
would take Callender's book with him to Richmond,
and that, "if Virginia was not too depraved" to furnish
a jury of respectable men, he would certainly
punish Callender. He would teach the lawyers of
Virginia the difference between the liberty and the
licentiousness of the press.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> On the road to Richmond,
James Triplett boarded the stage that carried
the avenging Justice of the Supreme Court. He
told Chase that Callender had once been arrested
in Virginia as a vagrant. "It is a pity," replied
Chase, "that they had not hanged the rascal."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>But the people of Virginia, because of their hatred
of the Sedition Law, were ardent champions of Callender.
Richmond lawyers were hostile to Chase
and were the bitter enemies of the statute which
they knew he would enforce. Jefferson was anxious
that Callender "should be substantially defended,
whether in the first stages by public interference or
private contributors."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>One ambitious young attorney, George Hay, who
seven years later was to act as prosecutor in the
greatest trial at which John Marshall ever presided,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
volunteered to defend Callender, animated to this
course by devotion to "the cause of the Constitution,"
in spite of the fact that he "despised" his
adopted client.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> William Wirt was also inspired to
offer his services in the interest of free speech. These
Virginia attorneys would show this tyrant of the
National Judiciary that the Virginia bar could not
be borne down.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Of all this the hot-spirited Chase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
was advised; and he resolved to forestall the passionate
young defenders of liberty. He was as witty
as he was fearless, and throughout the trial brought
down on Hay and Wirt the laughter of the spectators.</p>

<p>But in the court-room there was one spectator
who did not laugh. John Marshall, then Secretary
of State, witnessed the proceedings<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> with grave
misgivings.</p>

<p>Chase frequently interrupted the defendant's
counsel. "What," said he, "must there be a departure
from common sense to find out a construction
favorable" to Callender? The Justice declared that
a legal point which Hay attempted to make was "a
wild notion."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> When a juror said that he had never
seen the indictment or heard it read, Chase declared
that of course he could not have formed or delivered
an opinion on the charges; and then denied the
request that the indictment be read for the information
of the juror. Chase would not permit that
eminent patriot and publicist, Colonel John Taylor
of Caroline, to testify that part of Callender's statement
was true; "No evidence is admissible," said
the Justice, "that does not ... justify the whole
charge."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>William Wirt, in addressing the jury, was arguing
that if the jury believed the Sedition Act to be unconstitutional,
and yet found Callender guilty, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
"would violate their oath." Chase ordered him to
sit down. The jury had no right to pass upon the
constitutionality of the law&mdash;"such a power would
be extremely dangerous. Hear my words, I wish the
world to know them." The Justice then read a long
and very able opinion which he had carefully prepared
in anticipation that this point would be raised
by the defense.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> After another interruption, in which
Chase referred to Wirt as "the <i>young gentleman</i>"
in a manner that vastly amused the audience, the
discomfited lawyer, covered with confusion, abandoned
the case.</p>

<p>When Hay, in his turn, was addressing the jury,
Chase twice interrupted him, asserting that the
beardless attorney was not stating the law correctly.
The reporter notes that thereupon "Mr. Hay folded
up and put away his papers ... and refused to proceed."
The Justice begged him to go on, but Hay
indignantly stalked from the room.</p>

<p>Acting under the instructions of Chase, Callender
was convicted. The court sentenced him to imprisonment
for nine months, and to pay a fine of two
hundred dollars.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The proceedings at this trial were widely published.
The growing indignation of the people at the
courts rose to a dangerous point. The force of popu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>lar
wrath was increased by the alarm of the bar,
which generally had been the stanch supporter of
the bench.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Hastening from Richmond to New Castle, Delaware,
Justice Chase emphasized the opinion now
current that he was an American Jeffreys and typical
of the spirit of the whole National Judiciary. Upon
opening court, he said that he had heard that there
was a seditious newspaper in the State. He directed
the United States Attorney to search the files of all
the papers that could be found, and to report any
abusive language discovered. It was the haying season,
and the grand jury, most of whom were farmers,
asked to be discharged, since there was no business
for them to transact. Chase refused and held them
until the next day, in order to have them return
indictments against any printer that might have
criticized the Administration.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But the prosecutor's
investigation discovered nothing "treasonable" except
a brief and unpleasant reference to Chase himself.
So ended the Delaware visit of the ferret of the
National Judiciary.</p>

<p>Thus a popular conviction grew up that no man
was safe who assumed to criticize National officials.
The persecution of Matthew Lyon was recalled, and
the punishment of other citizens in cases less widely
known<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> became the subject of common talk,&mdash;all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
adding to the growing popular wrath against the
whole National Judiciary. The people regarded
those brought under the lash of justice as martyrs
to the cause of free speech; and so, indeed, they
were.</p>

<p>The method of securing indictments and convictions
also met with public condemnation. In many
States the United States Marshals selected what
persons they pleased as members of the grand juries
and trial juries. These officers of the National courts
were, without exception, Federalists; in many cases
Federalist politicians. When making up juries they
selected only persons of the same manner of thinking
as that of the marshals and judges themselves.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> So
it was that the juries were nothing more than
machines that registered the will, opinion, or even
inclination of the National judges and the United
States District Attorneys. In short, in these prose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>cutions,
trial by jury in any real sense was not to be
had.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Certain State judges of the rabid Federalist type,
apostles of "the wise, the rich, and the good" political
religion, were as insulting in their bearing, as immoderate
in their speech, and as intolerant in their conduct
as some of the National judges; and prosecutions
in some State courts were as bad as the worst
of those in the National tribunals.</p>

<p>In Boston, when the Legislature of Massachusetts
was considering the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions,
John Bacon of Berkshire, a Republican State
Senator, and Dr. Aaron Hill of Cambridge, the
leader of the Republicans in the House, resisted the
proposed answer of the Federalist majority. Both
maintained the ground upon which Republicans
everywhere now stood&mdash;that any State might disregard
an act of Congress which it deemed unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Bacon and Hill were supported by the
solid Republican membership of the Massachusetts
Legislature, which the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> of Boston,
a Federalist organ, called a "contemptible minority,"
every member of which was "worse than an infidel."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Independent Chronicle</i>, the Republican newspaper
of Boston, observed that "It is difficult for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
common capacities to conceive of a sovereignty so
situated that the <i>Sovereign shall have no right to decide
on any invasion of his constitutional powers</i>."
Bacon's speech, said the <i>Chronicle</i>, "has been read
with delight by all true Republicans, and will always
stand as a monument of his firmness, patriotism,
and integrity.... The name of an <i>American</i> Bacon
will be handed down to the latest generations of
freemen with high respect and gratitude, while the
names of such as have aimed a <i>death wound</i> to the
Constitution of the United States will rot <i>above
ground</i> and be unsavoury to the nostrils of every
lover of Republican freedom."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Massachusetts Mercury</i> of February 22, 1799,
reports that "On Tuesday last ... Chief Justice
Dana ... commented on the contents of the <i>Independent
Chronicle</i> of the preceding day. He properly
stated to the Jury that though he was not a subscriber
to the paper, he obtained <i>that one</i> by accident,
that if he was, his conscience would charge him with
assisting to support a traitorous enmity to the
Government of his Country."</p>

<p>Thereupon Thomas Adams, the publisher, and
Abijah Adams, a younger brother employed in the
office, were indicted under the common law for attempting
"to bring the government into disrespect,
hatred, and contempt," and for encouraging sedition.
Thomas Adams was fatally ill and Abijah only
was brought to trial. Under the instructions of the
court he was convicted. In pronouncing sentence
Chief Justice Dana delivered a political lecture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, he said,
had attempted "to establish the monstrous position"
that the individual States had the right to pass
upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress. He
then gave a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the reply of the majority of
the Massachusetts Legislature to the Virginia Resolutions.
This reply asserted that the decisions of all
questions arising under the Constitution and laws
of the United States "are exclusively vested in the
Judicial Courts of the United States," and that the
Sedition Act was "wise and necessary, as an audacious
and unprincipled spirit of falsehood and abuse
had been too long unremittingly exerted for the purpose
of <i>perverting</i> public opinion, and threatened to
undermine the whole fabric of government." The
irate judge declared that the <i>Chronicle's</i> criticism of
this action of the majority of the Legislature and its
praise of the Republican minority of that body was
an "indecent and outrageous calumny."</p>

<p>"Censurable as the libel may be in itself," Dana
continued, the principles stated by Adams's counsel
in conducting his defense were equally "dangerous
to public tranquility." These daring lawyers had
actually maintained the principle of the liberty of
the press. They had denied that an American citizen
could be punished under the common law of
England. "Novel and disorganizing doctrines," exclaimed
Dana in the midst of a long argument to
prove that the common law was operative in the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of the fact that Abijah Adams was not the
author of the libel, nor even the publisher or editor
of the <i>Chronicle</i>, but was "the only person to whom
the public can look for retribution," the court graciously
sentenced him to only one month's imprisonment,
but required him to find sureties for his good
behavior for a year, and to pay the costs of the
trial.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Alexander Addison, the presiding judge of one of
the Pennsylvania State courts, was another Federalist
State judge whose judicial conduct and assaults
from the bench upon democracy had helped to bring
courts into disrepute. Some of his charges to grand
juries were nothing but denunciations of Republican
principles.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>His manner on the bench was imperious; he bul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>lied
counsel, browbeat witnesses, governed his associate
judges, ruled juries. In one case,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Addison
forbade the Associate Judge to address the jury, and
prevented him from doing so.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Nor did the judges stop with lecturing everybody
from the bench. Carrying with them the authority
of their exalted positions, more than one of them,
notably Justice Chase and Judge Addison, took the
stump in political campaigns and made partisan
speeches.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>So it fell out that the manners, language, and conduct
of the judges themselves, together with their
use of the bench as a political rostrum, their partisanship
as to the European belligerents, their merciless
enforcement of the common law&mdash;aroused
that public fear and hatred of the courts which
gave Jefferson and the Republicans their opportunity.
The questions which lay at the root of the
Republican assault upon the Judiciary would not of
themselves, and without the human and dramatic
incidents of which the cases mentioned are examples,
have wrought up among citizens that fighting
spirit essential to a successful onslaught upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
National system of justice, which the Federalists
had made so completely their own.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Those basic questions thus brought theatrically
before the people's eyes, had been created by the
Alien and Sedition Laws, and by the Virginia and
Kentucky Resolutions which those undemocratic
statutes called forth. Freedom of speech on the one
hand and Nationalism on the other hand, the crushing
of "sedition" as against that license which Localism
permitted&mdash;such were the issues which the
imprudence and hot-headedness of the Federalist
judges had brought up for settlement. Thus, unhappily,
democracy marched arm in arm with State
Rights, while Nationalism found itself the intimate
companion of a narrow, bigoted, and retrograde
conservatism.</p>

<p>Had not the Federalists, arrogant with power and
frantic with hatred of France and fast becoming
zealots in their championship of Great Britain,
passed the drastic laws against liberty of the press
and freedom of speech; had not the Republican
protest against these statutes taken the form of the
assertion that individual States might declare uncon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>stitutional
and disregard the acts of the National
Legislature; and finally, had not National tribunals
and some judges of State courts been so harsh and
insolent, the Republican assault upon the National
Judiciary,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the echoes of which loudly sound in our
ears even to the present day, probably never would
have been made.</p>

<p>But for these things, Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> might
never have been written; the Supreme Court might
have remained nothing more than the comparatively
powerless institution that ultimate appellate judicial
establishments are in other countries; and the career
of John Marshall might have been no more notable
and distinguished than that of the many ghostly
figures in the shadowy procession of our judicial history.
But the Republican condemnations of the severe
punishment that the Federalists inflicted upon
anybody who criticized the Government, raised fundamental
issues and created conditions that forced
action on those issues.</p>

George Cabot was the ablest, most moderate and far-seeing of the
New England Federalists. He feared and detested what he called
"excessive democracy" as much as did Ames, or Pickering, or Dwight,
but, unlike his brother partisans, did not run to the opposite extreme
himself and never failed to assert the indispensability of the democratic
element in government. Cabot was utterly without personal ambition
and was very indolent; otherwise he surely would have occupied a
place in history equal to that of men like Madison, Gallatin, Hamilton,
and Marshall.</p></div>

Immediately after his inauguration, Jefferson restated the American
foreign policy announced by Washington. It was the only doctrine on
which he agreed with Marshall.
</p><p>
"It ought to be the very first object of our pursuits to have nothing
to do with European interests and politics. Let them be free or slaves
at will, navigators or agricultural, swallowed into one government or
divided into a thousand, we have nothing to fear from them in any

The democratic revolution that overthrew Federalism was the
beginning of the movement that finally arrived at the abolition of imprisonment
for debt, the bestowal of universal manhood suffrage, and,
in general, the more direct participation in every way of the masses
of the people in their own government. But in the first years of Republican
power there was a pandering to the crudest popular tastes
and passions which, to conservative men, argued a descent to the
sansculottism of France.</p></div>

Jefferson appears to have been confused as to the possibility of
repealing the Judiciary Act of 1801. A fortnight before he informed
Stuart that this course would be taken, he wrote Giles that "the
courts being so decidedly federal and irremovable," it was "indispensably
necessary" to appoint "republican attorneys and marshals."

</p><p>
Braintree, Mass., in 1786, in a town meeting, denounced lawyers
and demanded by formal resolution the enactment of "such laws ... as
may crush or, at least, put a proper check of restraint" upon them.
</p><p>
Dedham, Mass., instructed its members of the Legislature to secure
the passage of laws that would "check" attorneys; and if this
were not practicable, then "you are to endeavor [to pass a bill declaring]
that the order of Lawyers be totally abolished." (Warren: <i>History
of the American Bar</i>, 215.) All this, of course, was the result of the
bitter hardships of debtors.</p></div>

The subscription paper, probably drawn by Colonel John Taylor,
in whose hands the money was placed, declared that Callender "has
a cause closely allied to the preservation of the Constitution, and to
the freedom of public opinion; and that he ought to be comforted
in his bonds."
</p><p>
Callender was "a sufferer for those principles." Therefore, and
"because also he is poor and has three infant children who live by his
daily labor" the contributors freely gave the money "to be applied
to the use of James T. Callender, and if he should die in prison, to the
use of his children." (<i>Independent Chronicle</i>, Boston, July 10, 1800.)</p></div>

One Jedediah Peck, Assemblyman from Otsego County, N.Y., circulated
among his neighbors a petition to Congress to repeal the Alien

United States District Attorney for New York, who procured the indictment
of Peck; and upon bench warrant, the offender was arrested
and taken to New York for trial. It seems that such were the demonstrations
of the people, wherever Peck appeared in custody of the
officer, that the case was dropped. (Randall, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 420.)</p></div>

They had not the least reference to any business before the

written with uncommon ability. It is doubtful whether any
arguments more weighty have since been produced against what
George Cabot called "excessive democracy." These grand jury
charges of Addison were entitled: "Causes and Error of Complaints
and Jealousy of the Administration of the Government"; "Charges
to the Grand Juries of the County Court of the Fifth Circuit of the
State of Pennsylvania, at December Session, 1798"; "The Liberty of
Speech and of the Press"; "Charge to Grand Juries, 1798"; "Rise

</p><p>
On the other hand, wherever Republicans occupied judicial positions,
the voice from the bench, while contrary to that of the Federalist
judges, was no less harsh and absolute.
</p><p>
For instance, the judges of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire
refused to listen to the reading of British law reports, because they
were from "musty, old, worm-eaten books." One of the judges declared
that "not Common Law&mdash;not the quirks of Coke and Blackstone&mdash;but
common sense" controlled American judges. (Warren,

<h3>THE ASSAULT ON THE JUDICIARY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The angels of destruction are making haste. Our judges are to be as independent
as spaniels. (Fisher Ames.)</p>

<p>The power which has the right of passing, without appeal, on the validity of
your laws, is your sovereign. (John Randolph.)</p></div>


<p>On January 6, 1802, an atmosphere of intense but
suppressed excitement pervaded the little semi-circular
room where the Senate of the United States
was in session.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The Republican assault upon the
Judiciary was about to begin and the Federalists
in Congress had nerved themselves for their last
great fight. The impending debate was to prove one
of the permanently notable engagements in American
legislative history and was to create a situation
which, in a few months, forced John Marshall to
pronounce the first of those fundamental opinions
which have helped to shape and which still influence
the destiny of the American Nation.</p>

<p>The decision of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison was to be
made inevitable by the great controversy to which
we are now to listen. Marshall's course, and, indeed,
his opinion in this famous case, cannot be
understood without a thorough knowledge of the
notable debate in Congress which immediately
preceded it.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Never was the effect of the long years of party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
training which Jefferson had given the Republicans
better manifested than now. There was unsparing
party discipline, perfect harmony of party plan.
The President himself gave the signal for attack, but
with such skill that while his lieutenants in House
and Senate understood their orders and were eager
to execute them, the rank and file of the Federalist
voters, whom Jefferson hoped to win to the Republican
cause in the years to come, were soothed rather
than irritated by the seeming moderation and reasonableness
of the President's words.</p>

<p>"The Judiciary system ... and especially that portion
of it recently enacted, will, of course, present
itself to the contemplation of Congress," was the
almost casual reference in the President's first Message
to the Republican purpose to subjugate the
National Judiciary. To assist Senators and Representatives
in determining "the proportion which the
institution bears to the business it has to perform"
Jefferson had "procured from the several states ...
an exact statement of all the causes decided since
the first establishment of the courts and of the causes
which were pending when additional courts and
judges were brought to their aid." This summary
he transmitted to the law-making body.</p>

<p>In a seeming spirit of impartiality, almost of indifference,
the President suggested Congressional
inquiry as to whether jury trials had not been withheld
in many cases, and advised the investigation
of the manner of impaneling juries.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far and no farther went the comments on the
National Judiciary which the President laid before
Congress. The status of the courts&mdash;a question
that filled the minds of all, both Federalists and
Republicans&mdash;was not referred to. But the thought
of it thrilled Jefferson, and only his caution restrained
him from avowing it. Indeed, he had actually
written into the message words as daring as
those of his cherished Kentucky Resolutions; had
boldly declared that the right existed in each department
"to decide on the validity of an act according
to its own judgment and uncontrolled by
the opinions of any other department"; had asserted
that he himself, as President, had the authority and
power to decide the constitutionality of National
laws; and had, as President, actually pronounced, in
official form, the Sedition Act to be "in palpable and
unqualified contradiction to the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>This was not merely a part of a first rough draft of
this Presidential document, nor was it lightly cast
aside. It was the most important paragraph of the
completed Message. Jefferson had signed it on December
8, 1801, and it was ready for transmission
to the National Legislature. But just before sending
the Message to the Capitol, he struck out this passage,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
and thus notes on the margin of the draft his
reason for doing so: "This whole paragraph was
omitted as capable of being chicaned, and furnishing
something to the opposition to make a handle of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
It was thought better that the message should be
clear of everything which the public might be made
to misunderstand."</p>

<p>Although Jefferson's programme, as stated in the
altered message which he finally sent to Congress,
did not arouse the rank and file of Federalist voters,
it did alarm and anger the Federalist chieftains, who
saw the real purpose back of the President's colorless
words. Fisher Ames, that delightful reactionary,
thus interpreted it: "The message announces the
downfall of the late revision of the Judiciary; economy,
the patriotism of the shallow and the trick of
the ambitious.... The U. S. Gov't ... is to be dismantled
like an old ship.... The state gov'ts are to
be exhibited as alone safe and salutary."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The Judiciary Law of 1801, which the Federalist
majority enacted before their power over legislation
passed forever from their hands, was one of the best
considered and ablest measures ever devised by that
constructive party.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Almost from the time of the
organization of the National Judiciary the National
judges had complained of the inadequacy and positive
evils of the law under which they performed
their duties. The famous Judiciary Act of 1789,
which has received so much undeserved praise, did
not entirely satisfy anybody except its author,
Oliver Ellsworth. "It is a child of his and he defends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
it ... with wrath and anger," wrote Maclay in his
diary.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>In the first Congress opposition to the Ellsworth
Act had been sharp and determined. Elbridge Gerry
denounced the proposed National Judiciary as "a
tyranny."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Samuel Livermore of New Hampshire
called it "this new fangled system" which "would ...
swallow up the State Courts."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> James Jackson of
Georgia declared that National courts would cruelly
harass "the poor man."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>  Thomas Sumter of South
Carolina saw in the Judiciary Bill "the iron hand of
power."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Maclay feared that it would be "the gunpowder
plot of the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>When the Ellsworth Bill had become a law, Senator
William Grayson of Virginia advised Patrick
Henry that it "wears so monstrous an appearance
that I think it will be <i>felo-de-se</i> in the execution....
Whenever the Federal Judiciary comes into operation,
... the pride of the states ... will in the end
procure its destruction"<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>&mdash;a prediction that came
near fulfillment and probably would have been realized
but for the courage of John Marshall.</p>

<p>While Grayson's eager prophecy did not come to
pass, the Judiciary Act of 1789 worked so badly
that it was a source of discontent to bench, bar,
and people. William R. Davie of North Carolina, a
member of the Convention that framed the Constitution
and one of the most eminent lawyers of his
time, condemned the Ellsworth Act as "so defective<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
... that ... it would disgrace the composition of the
meanest legislature of the States."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>It was, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> because of the deficiencies
of the original Judiciary Law that Jay refused
reappointment as Chief Justice. "I left the bench,"
he wrote Adams, "perfectly convinced that under a
system so defective it would not obtain the energy,
weight, and dignity which are essential to its affording
due support to the national government, nor acquire
the public confidence and respect which, as the last
resort of the justice of the nation, it should possess."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The six Justices of the Supreme Court were required
to hold circuit courts in pairs, together with
the judge of the district in which the court was held.
Each circuit was to be thus served twice every year,
and the Supreme Court was to hold two sessions
annually in Washington.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> So great were the distances
between places where courts were held, so
laborious, slow, and dangerous was all travel,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the Justices&mdash;men of ripe age and studious habits&mdash;spent
a large part of each year upon the road.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Sometimes a storm would delay them, and litigants
with their assembled lawyers and witnesses would
have to postpone the trial for another year or await,
at the expense of time and money, the arrival of the
belated Justices.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>A graver defect of the act was that the Justices,
sitting together as the Supreme Court, heard on appeal
the same causes which they had decided on the
Circuit Bench. Thus, in effect, they were trial and
appellate judges in identical controversies. Moreover,
by the rotation in riding circuits different
judges frequently heard the same causes in their
various stages, so that uniformity of practice, and
even of decisions, was made impossible.</p>

<p>The admirable Judiciary Act, passed by the Federalists
in 1801, corrected these defects. The membership
of the Supreme Court was reduced to five after
the next vacancy, the Justices were relieved of the
heavy burden of holding circuit courts, and their
duties were confined exclusively to the Supreme
Bench. The country was divided into sixteen circuits,
and the office of circuit judge was created for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
each of these. The Circuit Judge, sitting with the
District Judge, was to hold circuit court, as the Justices
of the Supreme Court had formerly done. Thus
the prompt and regular sessions of the circuit courts
were assured. The appeal from decisions rendered
by the Supreme Court Justices, sitting as circuit
judges, to the same men sitting as appellate judges,
was done away with.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In establishing these new circuits and creating
these circuit judges, this excellent Federalist law
gave Adams the opportunity to fill the offices thus
created with stanch Federalist partisans. Indeed,
this was one motive for the enactment of the law.
The salaries of the new circuit judges, together with
other necessary expenses of the remodeled system,
amounted to more than fifty thousand dollars every
year&mdash;a sum which the Republicans exaggerated in
their appeals to the people and even in their arguments
in Congress.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Chiefly on the pretext of this alleged extravagance,
but in reality to oust the newly appointed Federalist
judges and intimidate the entire National Judiciary,
the Republicans, led by Jefferson, determined to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>peal
the Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801, upon the
faith in the passage of which John Marshall, with
misgiving, had accepted the office of Chief Justice.</p>

<p>On January 6, 1802, Senator John Breckenridge
of Kentucky pulled the lanyard that fired the opening
gun.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He was the personification of anti-Nationalism
and aggressive democracy. He moved the
repeal of the Federalist National Judiciary Act of
1801.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Every member of Senate and House&mdash;Republican
and Federalist&mdash;was uplifted or depressed
by the vital importance of the issue thus brought to
a head; and in the debate which followed no words
were too extreme to express their consciousness of
the gravity of the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>In opening the debate, Senator Breckenridge confined
himself closely to the point that the new Federalist
judges were superfluous. "Could it be necessary,"
he challenged the Federalists, "to <i>increase</i>
courts when suits were <i>decreasing</i>? ... to multiply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
judges, when their duties were diminishing?" No!
"The time never will arrive when America will stand
in need of thirty-eight Federal Judges."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The Federalist
Judiciary Law was "a wanton waste of the
public treasure."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Moreover, the fathers never intended
to commit to National judges "subjects of
litigation which ... could be left to State Courts."
Answering the Federalist contention that the Constitution
guaranteed to National judges tenure of
office during "good behavior" and that, therefore,
the offices once established could not be destroyed
by Congress, the Kentucky Senator observed that
"sinecure offices, ... are not permitted by our laws
or Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>James Monroe, then in Richmond, hastened to inform
Breckenridge that "your argument ... is highly
approved here." But, anxiously inquired that foggy
Republican, "Do you mean to admit that the legislature
[Congress] has not a right to repeal the law
organizing the supreme court for the express purpose
of dismissing the judges when they cease to possess
the public confidence?" If so, "the people have
no check whatever on them ... but impeachment."
Monroe hoped that "the period is not distant" when
any opposition to "the sovereignty of the people"
by the courts, such as "the application of the principles
of the English common law to our constitution,"
would be considered "good cause for impeachment."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
Thus early was expressed the Republican
plan to impeach and remove Marshall and the entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Federal membership of the Supreme Court so soon
to be attempted.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In reply to Breckenridge, Senator Jonathan
Mason of Massachusetts, an accomplished Boston
lawyer, promptly brought forward the question in
the minds of Congress and the country. "This,"
said he, "was one of the most important questions
that ever came before a Legislature." Why had the
Judiciary been made "as independent of the Legislature
as of the Executive?" Because it was their
duty "to expound not only the laws, but the Constitution
also; in which is involved the power of
checking the Legislature in case it should pass any
laws in violation of the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The old system which the Republicans would now
revive was intolerable, declared Senator Gouverneur
Morris of New York. "Cast an eye over the extent
of our country" and reflect that the President, "in
selecting a character for the bench, must seek less
the learning of a judge than the agility of a post
boy." Moreover, to repeal the Federal Judiciary
Law would be "a declaration to the remaining
judges that they hold their offices subject to your
[Congress's] will and pleasure." Thus "the check
established by the Constitution is destroyed."</p>

<p>Morris expounded the conservative Federalist
philosophy thus: "Governments are made to provide
against the follies and vices of men.... Hence,
checks are required in the distribution of power
among those who are to exercise it for the benefit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the people." The most efficient of these checks was
the power given the National Judiciary&mdash;"a check
of the first necessity, to prevent an invasion of the
Constitution by unconstitutional laws&mdash;a check
which might prevent any faction from intimidating
or annihilating the tribunals themselves."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Let the Republican Senators consider where their
course would end, he warned. "What has been the
ruin of every Republic? The vile love of popularity.
<i>Why are we here? To save the people from their most
dangerous enemy; to save them from themselves</i>."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Do
not, he besought, "commit the fate of America to
the mercy of time and chance."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Senator James Jackson
of Georgia, "is it possible that I have heard such a
sentiment in this body? Rather should I have expected
to have heard it sounded from the despots of
Turkey, or the deserts of Siberia.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>... I am more
afraid of an army of judges, ... than of an army of
soldiers.... Have we not seen sedition laws?" The
Georgia Senator "thanked God" that the terrorism
of the National Judiciary was, at last, overthrown.
"That we are not under dread of the patronage of
judges, is manifest, from their attack on the Secretary
of State."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Senator Uriah Tracy of Connecticut was so concerned
that he spoke in spite of serious illness.
"What security is there to an individual," he asked,
if the Legislature of the Union or any particular
State, should pass an <i>ex post facto</i> law? "None in
the world" but revolution or "an appeal to the Judiciary
of the United States, where he will obtain a
decision that the law itself is unconstitutional and
void."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>That typical Virginian, Senator Stevens Thompson
Mason, able, bold, and impetuous, now took up
Gouverneur Morris's gage of battle. He was one of
the most fearless and capable men in the Republican
Party, and was as impressive in physical appearance
as he was dominant in character. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
just under six feet in height, yet heavy with fat; he
had extraordinarily large eyes, gray in color, a wide
mouth with lips sternly compressed, high, broad
forehead, and dark hair, thrown back from his
brow. Mason had "wonderful powers of sarcasm"
which he employed to the utmost in this debate.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>It was true, he said, in beginning his address, that
the Judiciary should be independent, but not "independent
of the nation itself." Certainly the Judiciary
had not Constitutional authority "to control
the other departments of the Government."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Mason
hotly attacked the Federalist position that a
National judge, once appointed, was in office permanently;
and thus, for the second time, Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison was brought into the debate. "Have
we not heard this doctrine supported in the memorable
case of the mandamus, lately<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> before the
Supreme Court? Was it not there said [in argument
of counsel] that, though the law had a right
to establish the office of a justice of the peace, yet
it had not a right to abridge its duration to five
years?"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The true principle, Mason declared, was that
judicial offices like all others "are made for the good
of the people and not for that of the individual who
administers them." Even Judges of the Supreme
Court should do something to earn their salaries; but
under the Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801 "what
have they got to do? To try ten suits, [annually] for
such is the number now on their docket."</p>

<p>Mason now departed slightly from the Republican
programme of ignoring the favorite Federalist theory
that the Judiciary has the power to decide the constitutionality
of statutes. He fears that the Justices
of the Supreme Court "will be induced, from want
of employment, to do that which they ought not to
do.... They may ... hold the Constitution in one
hand, and the law in the other, and say to the departments
of Government, so far shall you go and no
farther." He is alarmed lest "this independence
of the Judiciary" shall become "something like supremacy."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Seldom in parliamentary contests has sarcasm, always
a doubtful weapon, been employed with finer
art than it was by Mason against Morris at this
time. The Federalists, in the enactment of the Judiciary
Act of 1801, had abolished two district courts&mdash;the
very thing for which the Republicans were
now assailed by the Federalists as destroyers of the
Constitution. Where was Morris, asked Mason,
when his friends had committed that sacrilege?
"Where was the <i>Ajax Telamon</i> of his party" at that
hour of fate? "Where was the hero with his seven-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>fold
shield&mdash;not of bull's hide, but of brass&mdash;prepared
to prevent or to punish this Trojan rape?"<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Morris replied lamely. He had been criticized, he
complained, for pointing out "the dangers to which
popular governments are exposed, from the influence
of designing demagogues upon popular passion."
Yet "'tis for these purposes that all our Constitutional
checks are devised." Otherwise "the Constitution
is all nonsense." He enumerated the Constitutional
limitations and exclaimed, "Why all these
multiplied precautions, unless to check and control
that impetuous spirit ... which has swept away
every popular Government that ever existed?"<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Should all else fail, "the Constitution has given us
... an independent judiciary" which, if "you trench
upon the rights of your fellow citizens, by passing an
unconstitutional law ... will stop you short." Preserve
the Judiciary in its vigor, and in great controversies
where the passions of the multitude are
aroused, "instead of a resort to arms, there will be a
happier appeal to argument."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Answering Mason's fears that the Supreme Court,
"having little else to do, would do mischief," Morris
avowed that he should "rejoice in that mischief,"
if it checked "the Legislative or Executive departments
in any wanton invasion of our rights.... I
know this doctrine is unpleasant; I know it is more
popular to appeal to public opinion&mdash;that equivocal,
transient being, which exists nowhere and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>where.
But if ever the occasion calls for it, I trust
the Supreme Court will not neglect doing the great
mischief of saving this Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>His emotions wrought to the point of oratorical
ecstasy, Morris now made an appeal to "the good
sense, patriotism, and ... virtue" of the Republic, in
the course of which he became badly entangled in
his metaphors. "Do not," he pleaded, "rely on that
popular will, which has brought us frail beings into
political existence. That opinion is but a changeable
thing. It will soon change. This very measure will
change it. You will be deceived. Do not ... commit
the dignity, the harmony, the existence of our nation
to the wild wind. Trust not your treasure to the
waves. Throw not your compass and your charts
into the ocean. Do not believe that its billows will
waft you into port. Indeed, indeed, you will be deceived.</p>

<p>"Cast not away this only anchor of our safety.
I have seen its progress. I know the difficulties
through which it was obtained. I stand in the presence
of Almighty God, and of the world; and I declare
to you, that if you lose this charter, never, no,
never will you get another! We are now, perhaps,
arrived at the parting point. Here, even here, we
stand on the brink of fate. Pause&mdash;Pause! For
Heaven's sake, pause!"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Senator Breckenridge would not "pause." The
"progress" of Senator Morris's "anchor," indeed,
dragged him again to "the brink of fate." The Senate
had "wandered long enough" with the Federal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>ist
Senators "in those regions of fancy and of terror,
to which they [have] led us." He now insisted that
the Senate return to the real subject, and in a speech
which is a model of compact reasoning, sharpened
by sarcasm, discussed all the points raised by the
Federalist Senators except their favorite one of the
power of the National Judiciary to declare acts
of Congress unconstitutional. This he carefully
avoided.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>On January 15, 1802, the new Vice-President of
the United States, Aaron Burr, first took the chair
as presiding officer of the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Within two
weeks<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> an incident happened which, though seemingly
trivial, was powerfully and dramatically to
affect the course of political events that finally encompassed
the ruin of the reputation, career, and
fortune of many men.</p>

<p>Senator Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey, in order,
as he claimed, to make the measure less objectionable,
moved that "the bill be referred to a select
committee, with instructions to consider and report
the alterations which may be proper in the judiciary
system of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> On this motion the
Senate tied; and Vice-President Burr, by his deciding
vote, referred the bill to the select committee.
In doing this he explained that he believed the
Federalists sincere in their wish "to ameliorate the
provisions of the bill, that it might be rendered more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
acceptable to the Senate." But he was careful to
warn them that he would "discountenance, by his
vote, any attempt, if any such should be made, that
might, in an indirect way, go to defeat the bill."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Five days later, one more Republican Senator,
being present, and one Federalist Senator, being
absent, the committee was discharged on motion
of Senator Breckenridge; and the debate continued,
the Federalists constantly accusing the Republicans
of a purpose to destroy the independence of the National
Judiciary, and asserting that National judges
must be kept beyond the reach of either Congress or
President in order to decide fearlessly upon the
constitutionality of laws.</p>

<p>At last the steady but spirited Breckenridge was so
irritated that he broke away from the Republican
plan to ignore this principal article of Federalist
faith. He did not intend to rise again, he said, but
"an argument had been so much pressed" that he
felt it must be answered. "I did not expect, sir, to
find the doctrine of the power of the courts to annul
the laws of Congress as unconstitutional, so seriously
insisted on.... I would ask where they got that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
power, and who checks the courts when they violate
the Constitution?"</p>

<p>The theory that courts may annul legislation
would give them "the absolute direction of the Government."
For, "to whom are they responsible?"
He wished to have pointed out the clause which
grants to the National Judiciary the power to overthrow
legislation. "Is it not extraordinary," said
he, "that if this high power was intended, it should
nowhere appear?... Never were such high and transcendant
powers in any Government (much less in
one like ours, composed of powers specially given
and defined) claimed or exercised by construction
only."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Breckenridge frankly stated the Republican philosophy,
repeating sometimes word for word the passage
which Jefferson at the last moment had deleted
from his Message to Congress.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> "The Constitution,"
he declared, "intended a separation of the powers
vested in the three great departments, giving to each
exclusive authority on the subjects committed to it....
Those who made the laws are presumed to have
an equal attachment to, and interest in the Constitution;
are equally bound by oath to support it, and
have an equal right to give a construction to it....
The construction of one department of the powers
vested in it, is of higher authority than the construction
of any other department.</p>

<p>"The Legislature," he continued, "have the exclusive
right to interpret the Constitution, in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
regards the law-making power, and the judges are
bound to execute the laws they make. For the Legislature
would have at least an equal right to annul
the decisions of the courts, founded on their construction
of the Constitution, as the courts would
have to annul the acts of the Legislature, founded on
their construction.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>... In case the courts were to
declare your revenue, impost and appropriation laws
unconstitutional, would they thereby be blotted out
of your statute book, and the operations of Government
arrested?... Let gentlemen consider well before
they insist on a power in the Judiciary which places
the Legislature at their feet."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>The candles<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> now dimly illuminating the little
Senate Chamber shed scarcely more light than radiated
from the broad, round, florid face of Gouverneur
Morris. Getting to his feet as quickly as his
wooden leg would permit, his features beaming with
triumph, the New York Senator congratulated "this
House, and all America, that we have at length got
our adversaries upon the ground where we can fairly
meet."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The power of courts to declare legislation invalid
is derived from "authority higher than this Constitution
... from the constitution of man, from the
nature of things, from the necessary progress of
human affairs,"<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> he asserted. In a cause on trial
before them, it becomes necessary for the judges to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
"declare what the law is. They must, of course,
determine whether that which is produced and relied
on, has indeed the binding force of law."</p>

<p>Suppose, said Morris, that Congress should pass
an act forbidden by the Constitution&mdash;for instance,
one laying "a duty on exports," and "the citizen
refuses to pay." If the Republicans were right, the
courts would enforce a collection. In vain would
the injured citizen appeal to the Supreme Court; for
Congress would "defeat the appeal, and render final
the judgment of inferior tribunals, subjected to their
absolute control." According to the Republican
doctrine, "the moment the Legislature ... declare
themselves supreme, they become so ... and the
Constitution is whatever they choose to make it."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
This time Morris made a great impression. The Federalists
were in high feather; even the Republicans
were moved to admiration. Troup reported to King
that "the democratical paper at Washington pronounced
his speech to be the greatest display of eloquence
ever exhibited in a deliberative assembly!"<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Federalist politicians were worried
by the apparent indifference of the rank and file
of their party. "I am surprized," wrote Bayard, "at
the public apathy upon the subject. Why do not
those who are opposed to the project, express in the
public papers or by petitions their disapprobation?...
It is likely that a public movement would have
great effect."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> But, thanks to the former conduct of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the judges themselves, no "public movement" developed.
Conservative citizens were apprehensive;
but, as usual, they were lethargic.</p>

<p>On February 3, 1802, the Senate, by a strictly
party vote<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> of 16 to 15, passed the bill to repeal the
Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>When the bill came up in the House, the Federalist
leader in that body, James A. Bayard of Delaware,
moved to postpone its consideration to the third
Monday in March, in order, as he said, to test public
opinion, because "few occasions have occurred so
important as this."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> But in vain did the Federalists
plead and threaten. Postponement was refused by
a vote of 61 to 35.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Another plea for delay was denied
by a vote of 58 to 34.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Thus the solid Republican
majority, in rigid pursuance of the party plan,
forced the consideration of the bill.</p>

<p>The Federalist organ in Washington, which Marshall
two years earlier was supposed to influence and
to which he probably contributed,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> saw little hope of
successful resistance. "What will eventually be the
issue of the present high-handed, overbearing proceedings
of Congress it is impossible to determine,"
but fear was expressed by this paper that conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
would be created "which impartial, unbiased and
reflecting men consider as immediately preceding the
total destruction of our government and the introduction
of disunion, anarchy and civil war."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>This threat of secession and armed resistance, already
made in the Senate, was to be repeated three
times in the debate in the House which was opened
for the Federalists by Archibald Henderson of North
Carolina, whom Marshall pronounced to be "unquestionably
among the ablest lawyers of his day"
and "one of the great lawyers of the Nation."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
"The monstrous and unheard of doctrine ... lately
advanced, that the judges have not the right of declaring
unconstitutional laws void," was, declared
Henderson, "the very definition of tyranny, and
wherever you find it, the people are slaves, whether
they call their Government a Monarchy, Republic,
or Democracy." If the Republican theory of the
Constitution should prevail, "better at once to bury
it with all our hopes."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Robert Williams of the same State, an extreme
but unskillful Republican, now uncovered his party's
scheme to oust Federalist judges, which thus far had
carefully been concealed:<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> "Agreeably to our Constitution
a judge may be impeached," said he, but
this punishment would be minimized if judges
could declare an act of Congress unconstitutional.
"However he may err, he commits no crime; how,
then, can he be impeached?"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip R. Thompson of Virginia, a Republican,
was moved to the depths of his being: "Give the
Judiciary this check upon the Legislature, allow
them the power to declare your laws null and void,
... and in vain have the people placed you upon this
floor to legislate.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>... This is the tree where despotism
lies concealed.... Nurture it with your treasure, stop
not its ramifications, and ... your atmosphere will be
contaminated with its poisonous effluvia, and your
soaring eagle will fall dead at its root."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Thomas T. Davis of Kentucky, deeply stirred by
this picture, declared that the Federalists said to the
people, you are "incapable" of protecting yourselves;
"in the Judiciary alone you find a safe deposit
for your liberties." The Kentucky Representative
"trembled" at such ideas. "The sooner we put men
out of power, who [<i>sic</i>] we find determined to act in
this manner, the better; by doing so we preserve
the power of the Legislature, and save our nation
from the ravages of an uncontrolled Judiciary."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Thus again was revealed the Republican purpose of
dragging from the National Bench all judges who
dared assert the right, and to exercise the power to
declare an act of Congress unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>The contending forces became ever more earnest
as the struggle continued. All the cases then known
in which courts directly or by inference had held
legislative acts invalid were cited;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and all the argu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>ments
that ever had been advanced in favor of the
principle of the judicial power to annul legislation
were made over and over again.</p>

<p>All the reasons for the opinion which John Marshall,
exactly one year later, pronounced in Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison were given during this debate. Indeed,
the legislative struggle now in progress and the result
of it, created conditions which forced Marshall
to execute that judicial <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. It should be repeated
that an understanding of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison
is impossible without a thorough knowledge of
the debate in Congress which preceded and largely
caused that epochal decision.</p>

<p>The alarm that the repeal was but the beginning
of Republican havoc was sounded by every
Federalist member. "This measure," said John
Stanley of North Carolina, "will be the first link
in that chain of measures which will add the name
of America to the melancholy catalogue of fallen
Republics."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>William Branch Giles, who for the next five years
bore so vital a part in the stirring events of Marshall's
life, now took the floor and made one of the
ablest addresses of his tempestuous career.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> He was
Jefferson's lieutenant in the House.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> When the Federalists
tried to postpone the consideration of the
bill,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Giles admitted that it presented a question
"more important than any that ever came before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
this house."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> But there was no excuse for delay,
because the press had been full of it for more than
a year and the public was thoroughly informed
upon it.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Giles was a large, robust, "handsome" Virginian,
whose lightest word always compelled the attention
of the House. He had a very dark complexion, black
hair worn long, and intense, "retreating" brown
eyes. His dress was "remarkably plain, and in the
style of Virginia carelessness." His voice was "clear
and nervous," his language "powerfully condensed."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>This Republican gladiator came boldly to combat.
How had the Federalists contrived to gain their
ends? Chiefly by "the breaking out of a tremendous
and unprecedented war in Europe," which had
worked upon "the feelings and sympathies of the
people of the United States" till they had neglected
their own affairs. So it was, he said, that the
Federalists had been able to load upon the people an
expensive army, a powerful navy, intolerable taxes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and the despotic Alien and Sedition Laws. But at
last, when, as the result of their maladministration,
the Federalists saw their doom approaching, they
began to "look out for some department of the government
in which they could entrench themselves ...
and continue to support those favorite principles of
irresponsibility which they could never consent to
abandon."</p>

<p>For this purpose they had selected the Judiciary
Department: "Not only because it was already
filled" with rabid Federalists, "but because they
held their offices by indefinite tenures, and of course
were further removed from any responsibility to the
people than either of the other departments." Thus
came the Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801 which the
Republicans were about to repeal.</p>

<p>Giles could not resist a sneer at Marshall. Referring
to the European war, to which "the feelings and
sympathies of the people of the United States were
so strongly attracted ... that they considered their
own internal concerns in a secondary point of view,"
Giles swiftly portrayed those measures used by the
Federalists as a pretext. They had, jeered the sharp-tongued
Virginia Republican, "pushed forward the
people to the X, Y, Z, of their political alphabet,
before they had well learned ... the A, B, C, of the
principles of the [Federalist] Administration."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>But now, when blood was no longer flowing on
European battle-fields, the interests of the American
people in that "tremendous and unprecedented"
combat of nations "no longer turn their attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
from their internal concerns; arguments of the highest
consideration for the safety of the Constitution
and the liberty of the citizens, no longer receive the
short reply, French partisans! Jacobins! Disorganizers!"<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
So "the American people and their Congress,
in their real persons, and original American
characters" were at last "engaged in the transaction
of American concerns."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Federalist despotism lay prostrate, thank Heaven,
beneath the conquering Republican heel. Should it
rise again? Never! Giles taunted the Federalists
with the conduct of Federalist judges in the sedition
cases,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and denounced the attempt to fasten British
law on the American Nation&mdash;a law "unlimited in
its object, and indefinite in its character," covering
"every object of legislation."</p>

<p>Think, too, of what Marshall and the Supreme
Court have done! "They have sent a ... process
leading to a mandamus, into the Executive cabinet,
to examine its concerns."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The real issue between
Federalists and Republicans, declared Giles, was
"the doctrine of irresponsibility against the doctrine
of responsibility.... The doctrine of despotism in
opposition to the representative system." The Federalist
theory was "an express avowal that the people
were incompetent to govern themselves."</p>

<p>A handsome, florid, fashionably attired man of
thirty-five now took the floor and began his reply to
the powerful speech of the tempestuous Virginian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
His complexion and stoutness indicated the generous
manner in which all public men of the time lived, and
his polished elocution and lofty scorn for all things
Republican marked him as the equal of Gouverneur
Morris in oratorical finish and Federalist distrust of
the people.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> It was James A. Bayard, the Federalist
leader of the House.</p>

<p>He asserted that the Republican "designs [were]
hostile to the powers of this government"; that they
flowed from "state pride [which] extinguishes a national
sentiment"; that while the Federalists were
in charge of the National Administration they struggled
"to maintain the Constitutional powers of the
Executive" because "the wild principles of French
liberty were scattered through the country. We had
our Jacobins and disorganizers, who saw no difference
between a King and a President; and, as the people
of France had put down their King, they thought
the people of America ought to put down their
President.</p>

<p>"They [Federalists] who considered the Constitution
as securing all the principles of rational and
practicable liberty, who were unwilling to embark
upon the tempestuous sea of revolution, in pursuit
of visionary schemes, were denounced as monarchists.
A line was drawn between the Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and the people, and the friends of the Government
[Federalists] were marked as the enemies of
the people."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> This was the spirit that was now
triumphant; to what lengths was it to carry the
Republicans? Did they include the downfall of the
Judiciary in their plans of general destruction? Did
they propose to make judges the mere creatures of
Congress?<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Bayard skillfully turned the gibe at Marshall into
a tribute to the Chief Justice. What did Giles mean
by his cryptic X. Y. Z. reference? "Did he mean
that the dispatches ... were impostures?" Though
Giles "felt no respect" for Marshall or Pinckney&mdash;"two
characters as pure, as honorable, and exalted,
as any the country can boast of"&mdash;yet, exclaimed
Bayard, "I should have expected that he would have
felt some tenderness for Mr. Gerry."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans had contaminated the country
with falsehoods against the Federalist Administrations;
and now the target of their "poisoned arrows"
was the National Judiciary. "If ... they
[the judges] have offended against the Constitution
or laws of the country, why are they not impeached?
The gentleman now holds the sword of justice. The
judges are not a privileged order; they have no
shelter but their innocence."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>In detail Bayard explained the facts in the case
of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison. That the Supreme Court
had been "hardy enough to send their mandate into
the Executive cabinet"<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> was, said he, "a strong proof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the value of that Constitutional provision which
makes them independent. They are not terrified by
the frowns of Executive power, and dare to judge
between the rights of a citizen and the pretensions
of a President."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Contrast the defects of the Judiciary Act of 1789
with the perfection of the Federalist law supplanting
it. Could any man deny the superiority of the latter?<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
The truth was that the Republicans were "to
give notice to the judges of the Supreme Court of
their fate, and to bid them to prepare for their end."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
In these words Bayard charged the Republicans
with their settled but unavowed purpose to unseat
Marshall and his Federalist associates.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Bayard hotly denied the Republican accusation
that President Adams had appointed to the bench
Federalist members of Congress as a reward for their
party services; but, retorted he, Jefferson had done
that very thing.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> He then spoke at great length on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the nature of the American Judiciary as distinguished
from that of British courts, gave a vivid
account of the passage of the Federalist Judiciary
Act under attack, and finally swung back to the subject
which more and more was coming to dominate
the struggle&mdash;the power of the Supreme Court to
annul acts of Congress.</p>

<p>Again and again Bayard restated, and with power
and eloquence, all the arguments to support the
supervisory power of courts over legislation.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> At last
he threatened armed resistance if the Republicans
dared to carry out their plans against the National
Judiciary. "There are many now willing to spill
their blood to defend that Constitution. Are gentlemen
disposed to risk the consequences?... Let them
consider their wives and children, their neighbors
and their friends." Destroy the independence of the
National Judiciary and "the moment is not far when
this fair country is to be desolated by civil war."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Bayard's speech aroused great enthusiasm among
the leaders of his party. John Adams wrote: "Yours
is the most comprehensive masterly and compleat
argument that has been published in either house
and will have, indeed ... has already had more effect
and influence on the public mind than all other publications
on the subject."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The <i>Washington Federalist</i>
pronounced Bayard's performance to be "far
superior, not only to ... the speeches of Mr. Morris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and Mr. Tracy in the Senate, but to any speech of a
Demosthenes, a Cicero, or a Chatham."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Hardly was Bayard's last word spoken when the
man who at that time was the Republican master of
the House, and, indeed, of the Senate also, was upon
his feet. Of medium stature, thin as a sword, his
straight black hair, in which gray already was beginning
to appear, suggesting the Indian blood in his
veins, his intense black eyes flaming with the passion
of combat, his high and shrilling voice suggesting
the scream of an eagle, John Randolph of Roanoke&mdash;that
haughty, passionate, eccentric genius&mdash;personified
the aggressive and ruthless Republicanism of
the hour. He was clad in riding-coat and breeches,
wore long riding-boots, and if the hat of the Virginia
planter was not on his head, it was because in his
nervousness he had removed it;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> while, if his riding-whip
was not in his hand, it was on his desk where
he had cast it, the visible and fitting emblem of this
strange man's mastery over his partisan followers.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"He did not rise," he said, his voice quivering and
body trembling,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> "for the purpose of assuming the
gauntlet which had been so proudly thrown by the
Goliah of the adverse party; not but that he believed
even his feeble powers, armed with the simple
weapon of truth, a sling and a stone, capable of prostrating
on the floor that gigantic boaster, armed
cap-a-pie as he was." Randolph sneered, as only he
could sneer, at the unctuous claims of the Federalists,
that they had "nobly sacrificed their political
existence on the altar of the general welfare"; he
refused "to revere in them the self-immolated victims
at the shrine of patriotism."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>As to the Federalist assertion that "the common
law of England is the law of the United States in
their confederate capacity," Randolph observed
that the meaning of such terms as "court," "jury,"
and the like must, of course, be settled by reference
to common-law definitions, but "does it follow that
that indefinite and undefinable body of law is the
irrepealable law of the land? The sense of a most
important phrase, 'direct tax,' as used in the Constitution,
has been ... settled by the acceptation of
Adam Smith; an acceptation, too, peculiar to himself.
Does the Wealth of Nations, therefore, form a
part of the Constitution of the United States?"</p>

<p>And would the Federalists inform the House what
phase of the common law they proposed to adopt for
the United States? Was it that "of the reign of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Elizabeth and James the first; or ... that of the time
of George the Second?" Was it that "of Sir Walter
Raleigh and Captain Smith, or that which was imported
by Governor Oglethorpe?"  Or was it that
of some intermediate period?  "I wish especially to
know," asked Randolph, "whether the common law
of libels which attaches to this Constitution, be the
doctrine laid down by Lord Mansfield, or that which
has immortalized Mr. Fox?" Let the Federalists
reflect on the persecution for libel that had been
made under the common law, as well as under the
Sedition Act.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Proper restraint upon Congress, said Randolph,
was not found in a pretended power of the Judiciary
to veto legislation, but in the people themselves,
who at the ballot box could "apply the Constitutional
corrective. That is the true check; every
other is at variance with the principle that a free
people are capable of self-government." Then the
imperious Virginian boldly charged that the Federalists
intended to have John Marshall and his associates
on the Supreme Bench annul the Republican
repeal of the Federalist Judiciary Act.</p>

<p>"Sir," cried Randolph, "if you pass the law, the
judges are to put their veto upon it by declaring it
unconstitutional. Here is a new power of a dangerous
and uncontrollable nature.... The decision of a
Constitutional question must rest somewhere. Shall
it be confided to men immediately responsible to the
people, or to those who are irresponsible?... From
whom is a corrupt decision most to be feared?...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
The power which has the right of passing, without
appeal, on the validity of your laws, is your sovereign....
Are we not as deeply interested in the true
exposition of the Constitution as the judges can be?"
inquired Randolph. "Is not Congress as capable of
forming a correct opinion as they are? Are not its
members acting under a responsibility to public
opinion which can and will check their aberrations
from duty?"</p>

<p>Randolph referred to the case of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison
and then recalled the prosecution of Thomas
Cooper in which the National court refused "to a
man under criminal prosecution ... a subp&#339;na to be
served on the President, as a witness on the part of
the prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>... This court, which it seems, has
lately become the guardian of the feeble and oppressed,
against the strong arm of power, found itself
destitute of all power to issue the writ....</p>

<p>"No, sir, you may invade the press; the courts
will support you, will outstrip you in zeal to further
this great object; your citizens may be imprisoned
and amerced, the courts will take care to see it executed;
the helpless foreigner may, contrary to the
express letter of your Constitution, be deprived of
compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his
defense; the courts in their extreme humility cannot
find authority for granting it."</p>

<p>Again Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison came into the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>bate:<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
"In their inquisitorial capacity," the Supreme
Court, according to Marshall's ruling in that
case, could force the President himself to discharge
his executive functions "in what mode" the omnipotent
judges might choose to direct. And Congress!
"For the amusement of the public, we shall retain
the right of debating but not of voting."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The
judges could forestall legislation by "inflammatory
pamphlets," as they had done.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>As the debate wore on, little that was new was
adduced. Calvin Goddard of Connecticut reviewed
the cases in which judges of various courts had asserted
the Federalist doctrine of the judicial power
to decide statutes unconstitutional,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and quoted from
Marshall's speech on the Judiciary in the Virginia
Convention of 1788.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>John Rutledge, Jr., of South Carolina, then delivered
one of the most distinguished addresses of this
notable discussion. Suppose, he said, that Congress
were to pass any of the laws which the Constitution
forbids, "who are to decide between the Constitution
and the acts of Congress?... If the people ...
[are] not shielded by some Constitutional checks"
their liberties will be "destroyed ... by demagogues,
who filch the confidence of the people by pretending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to be their friends; ... demagogues who carry daggers
in their hearts, and seductive smiles in their
hypocritical faces."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Rutledge was affected by the prevailing Federalist
pessimism. "This bill," said he, "is an egg which
will produce a brood of mortal consequences.... It
will soon prostrate public confidence; it will immediately
depreciate the value of public property. Who
will buy your lands? Who will open your Western
forests? Who will build upon the hills and cultivate
the valleys which here surround us?" The financial
adventurer who would take such risks "must be a
speculator indeed, and his purse must overflow ... if
there be no independent tribunals where the validity
of your titles will be confirmed.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>...</p>

<p>"Have we not seen a State [Georgia] sell its Western
lands, and afterwards declare the law under
which they were sold made null and void? Their
nullifying law would have been declared void, had
they had an independent Judiciary."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Here Rutledge
anticipated by eight years the opinion delivered
by Marshall in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>"Whenever in any country judges are dependent,
property is insecure." What had happened in
France? "Frenchmen received their constitution as
the followers of Mahomet did their Koran, as though
it came to them from Heaven. They swore on their
standards and their sabres never to abandon it. But,
sir, this constitution has vanished; the swords which
were to have formed a rampart around it, are now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
worn by the Consular janissaries, and the Republican
standards are among the trophies which decorate
the vaulted roof of the Consul's palace.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Indeed ...
[the] subject," avowed Rutledge with passionate
earnestness, "is perhaps as awful a one as any on
this side of the grave. This attack upon our Constitution
will form a great epoch in the history of our
Government."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Forcible resistance, if the Republican assault on
the Judiciary succeeded, had twice been intimated
during the debate. As yet, however, actual secession
of the Northern and Eastern States had not been
openly suggested, although it was common talk
among the Federalists;<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> but now one of the boldest
and frankest of their number broadly hinted it to be
the Federalist purpose, should the Republicans persist
in carrying out their purpose of demolishing the
National courts.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In closing a long, intensely partisan
and wearisome speech, Roger Griswold of Connecticut
exclaimed: "There are states in this Union who
will never consent and are not doomed to become
the humble provinces of Virginia."</p>

<p>Joseph H. Nicholson of Maryland, Republican,
was hardly less prolix than Griswold. He asked
whether the people had ever approved the adoption
of the common law by the Judiciary. "Have they
ever sanctioned the principle that the judges should
make laws for them instead of their Representatives?"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
Tiresome as he was, he made a conclusive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
argument against the Federalist position that the
National Judiciary might apply the common law in
cases not provided for by acts of Congress.</p>

<p>The debate ran into the month of March.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Every
possible phase of the subject was gone over time and
again. All authorities which the ardent and tireless
industry of the contending partisans could discover
were brought to light. The pending case of Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison was in the minds of all; and it was repeatedly
dragged into the discussion. Samuel W.
Dana of Connecticut examined it minutely, citing
the action of the Supreme Court in the case of the
application for a mandamus to the Secretary of War
upon which the court acted February 14, 1794:
"There does not appear to have been any question
respecting the general power of the Supreme Court,
to issue a mandamus to the Secretary of War, or
any other subordinate officer." That was "a regular
mode for obtaining a decision of the Supreme Court....
When such has been the unquestioned usage heretofore,
is it not extraordinary that there has not
been prudence enough to say less about the case of
Marbury against the Secretary of State?"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Dana then touched upon the general expectation
that Marshall would declare void the Repeal Act.
Because of this very apprehension, the Republicans,
a few days later, suspended for more than a year the
sessions of the Supreme Court. So Dana threatened
that if the Republicans should pass the bill, the Supreme
Court would annul it; for, said he, the Judiciary
were sworn to support the Constitution, and
when they find that instrument on one side and
an act of Congress on the other, "what is their
duty? Are they not to obey their oath, and judge
accordingly? If so, they necessarily decide, that
your act is of no force; for they are sworn to support
the Constitution. This is a doctrine coeval with the
existence of our Government, and has been the uniform
principle of all the constituted authorities."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
And he cited the position taken by National judges
in 1792 in the matter of the pension commission.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>John Bacon, that stanch Massachusetts Republican,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
asserted that "the Judiciary have no more
right to prescribe, direct or control the acts of the
other departments of the Government, than the
other departments of the Government have to prescribe
or direct those of the Judiciary."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans determined to permit no further
delay; for the first time in its history the House was
kept in session until midnight.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> At twelve o'clock,
March 3, 1802, the vote was taken on the final passage
of the bill, the thirty-two Federalists voting
against and the fifty-nine Republicans for the meas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>ure.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
"Thus ended this gigantic debate," chronicles
the historian of that event.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> No discussion in Congress
had hitherto been so widely reported in the
press or excited such general comment. By the great
majority of the people the repeal was received with
enthusiasm, although some Republicans believed
that their party had gone too far.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Republican papers,
however, hailed the repeal as the breaking of
one of those judicial fetters which shackled the people,
while Federalist journals bemoaned it as the beginning
of the annihilation of all that was sane and
worthy in American institutions.</p>

<p>"The fatal bill has passed; our Constitution is no
more," exclaimed the <i>Washington Federalist</i> in an
editorial entitled</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Farewell, a long Farewell, to all our Greatness</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>The paper despaired of the Republic&mdash;nobody
could tell "what other acts, urged by the intoxication
of power and the fury of party rage" would be
put through. But it announced that the Federalist
judges would disregard the infamous Republican
law: "The judges will continue to hold their courts
as if the bill had not passed. 'Tis their solemn duty
to do it; their country, all that is dear and valuable,
call upon them to do it. By the judges this bill will
be declared null and void.... And we now ask the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
mighty victors, what is your triumph?... What is
the triumph of the President? He has gratified his
malice towards the judges, but he has drawn a tear
into the eye of every thoughtful patriot ... and laid
the foundation of infinite mischief." The Federalist
organ declared that the Republican purpose was to
force a "dissolution of the Union," and that this
was likely to happen.</p>

<p>This significant editorial ended by a consideration
of the Republican purpose to destroy the Supreme
Court: "Should Mr. Breckenridge now bring forward
a resolution to repeal the law establishing the
Supreme Court of the United States, we should only
consider it a part of the system to be pursued.... We
sincerely expect it will be done next session.... Such
is democracy."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Senator Plumer declared, before the final vote,
that the passage of the Republican Repeal Bill and
of other Republican measures meant "anarchy."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>The ultra-Federalist <i>Palladium</i> of Boston lamented:
"Our army is to be less and our navy
nothing: Our Secretaries are to be aliens and our
Judges as independent as spaniels. In this way we
are to save everything, but our reputation and our
rights<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>... Has Liberty any citadel or fortress, has
mob despotism any impediments?"<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Independent Chronicle</i>, on the other hand,
"congratulated the public on the final triumph of
<i>Republicanism</i>, in the repeal of the late obnoxious
judiciary law."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The Republicans of Boston and
Cambridge celebrated the event with discharges of
artillery.</p>

<p>Vans Murray reported to King that "the principle
of ... disorganizing ... goes on with a destructive
zeal. Internal Taxes&mdash;Judicial Sanctity&mdash;all are
to be overset."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Sedgwick was sure that no defense
was left against "legislative usurpation."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> "The angels
of destruction ... are making haste," moaned
Fisher Ames.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>"The angels of destruction" lost no time in striking
their next blow. On March 18, two weeks after
the threat of the <i>Washington Federalist</i> that the
Supreme Court would declare unconstitutional the
Republican Repeal Act, a Senate committee was
appointed to examine further the National Judiciary
establishment and report a bill for any improvements
considered necessary.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Within a week the
committee laid the measure before the Senate,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> and
on April 8 it was passed<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> without debate.</p>

<p>When it reached the House, however, the Federalists
had taken alarm. The Federalist Judiciary Act of
1801 had fixed the terms of the Supreme Court in
December and June instead of February and August.
This new bill, plainly an afterthought, abolished the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
June session of the Supreme Court, directed that,
thereafter, that tribunal should convene but once
each year, and fixed the second Monday of February
as the time of this annual session.</p>

<p>Thus did the Republicans plan to take away from
the Supreme Court the opportunity to pass upon the
repeal of the Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801 until
the old and defective system of 1789, which it restored,
was again in full operation. Meanwhile, the
wrath of the new National judges, whom the repeal
left without offices, would wear itself down, and they
would accept the situation as an accomplished fact.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
John Marshall should have no early opportunity to
overturn the Repeal Act, as the Republicans believed
he would do if given the chance. Neither
should he proceed further with the case of Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison for many months to come.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Bayard moved that the bill should not go into
effect until July 1, thus permitting the Supreme Court
to hold its June session; but, said Nicholson, that was
just what the Republicans intended to prevent. Was
a June session of the Supreme Court "a source of
alarm?" asked Bayard. "The effect of the present
bill will be, to have no court for fourteen months....
Are gentlemen afraid of the judges? Are they afraid
that they will pronounce the repealing law void?"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Nicholson did not care whether the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Court "pronounced the repealing law unconstitutional
or not." The Republican postponement of the
session for more than a year "does not arise from
any design ... to prevent the exercise of power by the
judges." But what of the Federalists' solicitude for
an early sitting of the court? "We have as good a
right to suppose gentlemen on the other side are as
anxious for a session in June, that this power may
be exercised, as they have to suppose we wish to
avoid it, to prevent the exercise."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Griswold could not credit the Republicans with
so base a purpose: "I know that it has been said,
out of doors, that this is the great object of the bill.
I know there have been slanders of this kind; but
they are too disgraceful to ascribe to this body.
The slander cannot, ought not to be admitted." So
Griswold hoped that Republicans would permit the
Supreme Court to hold its summer session. He
frankly avowed a wish for an early decision that
the Repeal Act was void. "I think the speedier it
[usurpation] is checked the better."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Bayard at last flatly charged the Republicans
with the purpose of preventing the Supreme Court
from holding the Repeal Act unconstitutional.
"This act is not designed to amend the Judicial system,"
he asserted; "that is but pretense.... It is to
prevent that court from expressing their opinion
upon the validity of the act lately passed ... until
the act has gone into full execution, and the excitement
of the public mind is abated.... Could a
less motive induce gentlemen to agree to suspend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the sessions of the Supreme Court for fourteen
months?"<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>But neither the pleading nor the denunciation of
the Federalists moved the Republicans. On Friday,
April 23, 1802, the bill passed and the Supreme Court
of the United States was practically abolished for
fourteen months.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>At that moment began the movement that finally
developed into the plan for the secession of the New
England States from the Union. It is, perhaps, more
accurate to say that the idea of secession had never
been entirely out of the minds of the extreme New
England Federalist leaders from the time Theodore
Sedgwick threatened it in the debate over the Assumption
Bill.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Hints of withdrawing from the Union if Virginia
should become dominant crop out in their correspondence.
The Republican repeal of the Judiciary
Act immediately called forth many expressions in
Federalist papers such as this from the Boston <i>Palladium</i>
of March 2, 1802: "Whether the rights and
interests of the Eastern States would be perfectly
safe when Virginia rules the nation is a problem easy
to solve but terrible to contemplate.... As ambitious
<i>Virginia</i> will not be just, let valiant <i>Massachusetts</i> be
zealous."</p>

<p>Fisher Ames declared that "the federalists must
entrench themselves in the State governments, and
endeavor to make State justice and State power a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
shelter of the wise, and good, and rich, from the wild
destroying rage of the southern Jacobins."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> He
thought the Federalists had neglected the press.
"It is practicable," said he, "to rouse our sleeping
patriotism&mdash;sleeping, like a drunkard in the snow....
The newspapers have been left to the lazy or the
ill-informed, or to those who undertook singly work
enough for six."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Pickering, the truculent, brave, and persistent,
anticipated "a new confederacy.... There will be&mdash;and
our children at farthest will see it&mdash;a separation....

<p>The more moderate George Cabot, on the contrary,
thought that the strong defense made by the
Federalists in Congress would induce the Republicans
to cease their attacks on the National courts.
"The very able discussions of the Judiciary Question,"
he wrote, "&amp; great superiority of the Federalists
in all the debates &amp; public writings have manifestly
checked the career of the <i>Revolutionists</i>."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
But for once Cabot was wrong; the Republicans
were jubilant and hastened to press their assault
more vigorously than ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The Federalist newspapers teemed with long arguments
against the repeal and laboriously strove, in
dull and heavy fashion, to whip their readers into
fighting humor. These articles were little more than
turgid repetitions of the Federalist speeches in Congress,
with a passage here and there of the usual
Federalist denunciation. For instance, the <i>Columbian
Centinel</i>, after restating the argument against
the Repeal Act, thought that this "refutes all the
absurd doctrines of the Jacobins upon that subject,
... and it will be sooner or later declared by the people,
in a tone terrible to the present disorganizing
party, to be the true construction of their constitution,
and the only one compatible with their safety
and happiness."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Independent Chronicle</i>, on the other hand, was
exultant. After denouncing "the impudence and
scurrility of the Federal faction," a correspondent
of that paper proceeded in this fashion: "The Judiciary!
The Judiciary! like a wreck on Cape Cod
is dashing at every wave"; but, thank Heaven,
"instead of the 'Essex Junto's' Judiciary we are
sailing by the grace of God in the Washington
<i>Frigate</i>&mdash;our judges are as at first and Mr. Jefferson
has thought fit to practice the old navigation
and steer with the same compass by which <i>Admiral
Washington</i> regulated his log book. The Essex
Junto may be afraid to trust themselves on board
but every true Washington American will step on
board in full confidence of a prosperous voyage.

well illustrated by the experiences of six members of Congress, when
journeying to Philadelphia in 1790. "Burke was shipwrecked off the
Capes; Jackson and Mathews with great difficulty landed at Cape
May and traveled one hundred and sixty miles in a wagon to the city;
Burke got here in the same way. Gerry and Partridge were overset in
the stage; the first had his head broke, ... the other had his ribs sadly

The soundness of the Federalist Judiciary Act of 1801 was demonstrated
almost a century later, in 1891-95, when Congress re&euml;nacted
every essential feature of it. (See "Act to establish circuit courts
of appeals and to define and regulate in certain cases the jurisdiction
of the courts of the United States, and for other purposes," March
3, 1891, chap. 517, amended Feb. 18, 1895, chap. 96.)</p></div>

of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 into the Legislature of
that State. It was Breckenridge who had led the fight for them. At
the time of the judiciary debate he was Jefferson's spokesman in the
Senate; and later, at the President's earnest request, resigned as
Senator to become Attorney-General.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_170_170" id="Footnote_170_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> Breckenridge's constituents insisted that the law be repealed, because
they feared that the newly established National courts would
conflict with the system of State courts which the Legislature of Kentucky
had just established. (See Carpenter, <i>Am. Pol. Sci. Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">ix</span>, 523.)
</p><p>
Although the repeal had been determined upon by Jefferson almost
immediately after his inauguration (see Jefferson to Stuart, April 8,
1801; <i>Works</i>: Ford, <span class="smcap">ix</span>, 247), Breckenridge relied upon that most
fruitful of Republican intellects, John Taylor "of Caroline," the originator
of the Kentucky Resolutions (see vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 397, of this work) for
his arguments. See Taylor to Breckenridge, Dec. 22, 1801, <i>infra</i>,

miracle of making one convert. After he closed he was standing before
the glowing fireplace, "half dead with his exertions." Senator Colhoun
of South Carolina came to Tracy, and giving him his hand, said: "You
are a stranger to me, sir, but by &mdash;&mdash; you have made me your friend."
Colhoun said that he "had been told a thousand lies" about the Federalist
Judiciary Act, particularly the manner of passing it, and he had,
therefore, been in favor of repealing it. But Tracy had convinced
him, and Colhoun declared: "I shall be with you on the question."
"May we depend upon you?" asked Tracy, wringing the South Carolina
Senator's hand. "By &mdash;&mdash; you may," was the response. (Morison:

kept his word and voted with the Federalists against his party's pet
measure. (<i>Annals</i>, 7th Cong. 1st Sess. 185.)

Burr's action was perfectly correct. As an impartial presiding officer,
he could not well have done anything else. Alexander J. Dallas,
Republican Attorney-General of Pennsylvania, wrote the Vice-President
a letter approving his action. (Dallas to Burr, Feb. 3,
1802, Davis: <i>Memoirs of Aaron Burr</i>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 82.) Nathaniel Niles, a
rampant Republican, sent Burr a letter thanking him for his vote.
As a Republican, he wanted his party to be fair, he said. (Niles to
Burr, Feb. 17, 1802, <i>ib.</i> 83-84.) Nevertheless, Burr's vote was seized
upon by his enemies as the occasion for beginning those attacks upon
him which led to his overthrow and disgrace. (See chaps. <span class="smcap">vi</span>, <span class="smcap">vii</span>,

Giles was thirty-nine years of age. He had been elected to the House
in 1790, and from the day he entered Congress had exasperated the
Federalists. It is an interesting though trivial incident that Giles bore
to Madison a letter of introduction from Marshall. Evidently the
circumspect Richmond attorney was not well impressed with Giles,
for the letter is cautious in the extreme. (See Anderson, 10; also

both parties depended, finally cast his deciding vote in favor of Jefferson
and "Mr. Linn has since had the profitable office of supervisor
of his district conferred upon him"; and that Mr. Lyon of Vermont
neutralized the vote of his State, but since "his character was low ...
Mr. Lyon's son has been handsomely provided for in one of the
Executive offices." (<i>Annals</i>, 7th Cong. 1st Sess. 640.) Bayard named

Tyler, I, 291. Senator Plumer pictured him as "a pale, meagre, ghostly

of his party." (Plumer to Emery, Plumer, 248.) See also Plumer's
letter to his son, Feb. 22, 1803, in which the New Hampshire
Senator says that "Randolph goes to the House booted and spurred,
with his whip in his hand, in imitation, it is said, of members of the
British Parliament. He is a very slight man, but of the common
stature." At a distance he looks young, but "upon a nearer approach
you perceive his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about
thirty." (<i>Ib.</i> 256.)</p></div>

Dana's statement is of first importance and should be carefully
noted. It was at the time the universally accepted view of the power
of the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus. Neither Federalists
nor Republicans had ever questioned the Constitutional right of
the Supreme Court to entertain original jurisdiction of mandamus
proceedings in proper cases. Yet just this was what Marshall was so
soon to deny in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison. (See <i>infra</i>, chap. <span class="smcap">iii</span>.)</p></div>

<h3>MARBURY VERSUS MADISON</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions
would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>The constitution is either a superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary
means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts alterable when
the legislature shall please to alter it. It is emphatically the province and
duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. This is the very
essence of judicial duty. (Marshall.)</p>

<p>To have inscribed this vast truth of conservatism upon the public mind, so
that no demagogue not in the last stages of intoxication denies it&mdash;this is
an achievement of statesmanship which a thousand years may not exhaust
or reveal all that is good. (Rufus Choate.)</p></div>

"<span class="smcap">Rawleigh</span>, Jan<sup>y:</sup> 2<sup>d&#803;</sup> 1803<br />
</p><p class="noidt">
"<span class="smcap">My dearest Polly</span><br />
</p>

<p>"You will laugh at my vexation when you hear
the various calamaties that have befallen me. In
the first place when I came to review my funds, I
had the mortification to discover that I had lost 15
silver dollars out of my waist coat pocket. They had
worn through the various mendings the pocket had
sustained &amp; sought their liberty in the sands of
Carolina.</p>

<p>"I determined not to vex myself with what coud
not be remedied &amp; orderd Peter to take out my
cloaths that I might dress for court when to my astonishment
&amp; grief after fumbling several minutes in
the portmanteau, staring at vacancy, &amp; sweating
most profusely he turned to me with the doleful
tidings that I had no pair of breeches. You may be
sure this piece of inteligence was not very graciously
receivd; however, after a little scolding I determined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>to make the best of my situation &amp; immediately set
out to get a pair made.</p>

<p>"I thought I should be a sans culotte only one day
&amp; that for the residue of the term I might be well
enough dressd for the appearance on the first day to
be forgotten. But, the greatest of evils, I found, was
followed by still greater! Not a taylor in town coud
be prevaild on to work for me. They were all so busy
that it was impossible to attend to my wants however
pressing they might be, &amp; I have the extreme
mortification to pass the whole time without that
important article of dress I have mentiond. I have
no alleviation for this misfortune but the hope that I
shall be enabled in four or five days to commence
my journey homeward &amp; that I shall have the pleasure
of seeing you &amp; our dear children in eight or nine
days after this reaches you.</p>

<p>"In the meantime I flatter myself that you are
well &amp; happy.</p>

<p class="ralign">
"Adieu my dearest Polly &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
I am your ever affectionate &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
<span class="smcap">J Marshall</span>."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a><br />
</p>

<p>With the same unfailing light-heartedness which,
nearly a quarter of a century before, had cheered his
comrades at Valley Forge, John Marshall, Chief
Justice of the United States, thus went about his
duties and bore his troubles. Making his circuit in
a battered gig or sulky, which he himself usually
drove, absent-minded and laughing at himself for
the mishaps that his forgetfulness and negligence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>continually brought upon him, he was seemingly
unperturbed in the midst of the political upheaval.</p>

<p>Yet he was not at ease. Rufus King, still the
American Minister to Great Britain, had finally
settled the controversy over the British debts, upon
the very basis laid down by Marshall when Secretary
of State.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> But Jefferson's Administration now
did not hesitate to assert that this removal of one
cause of conflict with Great Britain was the triumph
of Republican diplomacy. Marshall, with unreserve
so unlike him, reveals to King his disgust and sense
of injury, and in doing so portrays the development
of political conditions.</p>

<p>"The advocates of the present administration
ascribe to it great praise," wrote Marshall to our
Minister in London, "for having, with so much dexterity
&amp; so little loss, extricated our country from
a debt of twenty-four million of dollars in which a
former administration had involved it.... The mortifying
reflection obtrudes itself, that the reputation
of the most wise &amp; skilful conduct depends, in this
our capricious world, so much on accident. Had
Mr. Adams been reelected President of the United
States, or had his successor been [a Federalist] ... a
very different reception ... would have been given
to the same measure.</p>

<p>"The payment of a specific sum would then have
been pronounced, by those who now take merit to
themselves for it, a humiliating national degradation,
an abandonment of national interest, a free
will offering of millions to Britain for her grace <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>&amp;
favor, by those who sought to engage in a war with
France, rather than repay, in part, by a small loan
to that republic, the immense debt of gratitude we
owe her."</p>

<p>So speaks with bitter sarcasm the new Chief Justice,
and pessimistically continues: "Such is, &amp; such
I fear will ever be human justice!" He tells King
that the Federalist "disposition to coalesce" with
the Republicans, which seemed to be developing
during the first few months after Jefferson's inauguration,
had disappeared; "but," he adds, "the minority
[Federalist Party] is only recovering its strength
&amp; firmness. It acquires nothing." Then, with the
characteristic misgivings of a Federalist, he prophesies:
"Our political tempests will long, very long,
exist, after those who are now toss'd about by them
shall be at rest."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>For more than five years<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Marshall had foreseen
the complicated and dangerous situation in which
the country now found itself; and for more than a
year<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> he had, in his ample, leisurely, simple manner
of thinking, been framing the constructive answer
which he was at last forced to give to the grave
question: Who shall say with final authority what is
and what is not law throughout the Republic? In
his opinion in the case of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, to
which this chapter is devoted, we shall see how John
Marshall answered this vital question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The philosophy of the Virginia and Kentucky
Resolutions had now become the ruling doctrine of
the Republican Party. The writer of the creed of
State Rights sat in the Executive chair, while in
House and Senate Virginia and her daughter Kentucky
ruled the Republican majority. The two
States that had declared the right and power of any
member of the Union to pronounce a National law
unconstitutional, and that had actually asserted a
National statute to be null and void, had become
the dominant force in the National Government.</p>

<p>The Federalist majority in the legislatures of ten
States,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> it is true, had passed resolutions denouncing
that anti-National theory, and had vigorously asserted
that the National Judiciary alone had the
power to invalidate acts of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> <i>But in none of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
these States had the Republican minority concurred</i>.
In all of them the Republicans had vigorously fought
the Federalist denial of the right and power of the
States to nullify National laws, and had especially
resisted the Federalist assertion that this power was
in the National Judiciary.</p>

<p>In the New York Legislature, forty-three Republicans
voted solidly against the Federalist reply to
Virginia and Kentucky, while the Federalists were
able to muster but fifty votes in its favor. In Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland, the Republican
opposition was determined and outspoken.</p>

<p>The thirty-three Republicans of the Vermont
Legislature cited, in their protest, the position
which Marshall had taken on the Sedition Law in his
campaign for Congress:<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> "We have ever been of an
opinion, with that much and deservedly respected
statesman, Mr. Marshall, (whose abilities and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>tegrity
have been doubted by no party, and whose
spirited and patriotic defence of his country's rights,
has been universally admired)<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> that 'it was calculated
to create <i>unnecessarily</i>, discontents and jealousies,
at a time, when our very existence as a nation
may depend on our union.'"<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In Southern States, where the Federalists were
dominant when Kentucky and Virginia adopted
their famous Resolutions, the Republicans were,
nevertheless, so strong that the Federalist majority
in the Legislatures of those States dared not attempt
to deny formally the new Republican gospel.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>So stood the formal record; but, since it had been
written, the Jeffersonian propaganda had drawn
scores of thousands of voters into the Republican
ranks. The whole South had now decisively repudiated
Federalism. Maryland had been captured;
Pennsylvania had become as emphatically Republican
as Virginia herself; New York had joined her
forces to the Republican legions. The Federalists
still held New England and the States of Delaware
and New Jersey, but even there the incessant Republican
assaults, delivered with ever-increasing
strength, were weakening the Federalist power.
Nothing was plainer than that, if the Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions had been submitted to the
Legislatures of the various States in 1801-1803, most
of them would have enthusiastically endorsed them.</p>

<p>Thus the one subject most discussed, from the
campaign of 1800 to the time when Marshall deliv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ered
his opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, was the all-important
question as to what power, if any, could
annul acts of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> During these years popular
opinion became ever stronger that the Judiciary
could not do so, that Congress had a free hand so far
as courts were concerned, and that the individual
States might ignore National laws whenever those
States deemed them to be infractions of the Constitution.
As we have seen, the Republican vote in
Senate and House, by which the Judiciary Act of
1801 was repealed, was also a vote against the theory
of the supervisory power of the National Judiciary
over National legislation.</p>

<p>Should this conclusion go unchallenged? If so, it
would have the sanction of acquiescence and soon
acquire the strength of custom. What then would
become the condition of the country? Congress
might pass a law which some States would oppose
and which they would refuse to obey, but which
other States would favor and of which they would
demand the enforcement. What would this entail?
At the very least it would provoke a relapse into
the chaos of the Confederation and more probably
civil war. Or a President might take it upon himself
to pronounce null and void a law of Congress,
as Jefferson had already done in the matter of the
Sedition Law,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and if House and Senate were of a
hostile political party, Congress might insist upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the observance of its legislation; but such a course
would seriously damage the whole machinery of the
National Government.</p>

<p>The fundamental question as to what power could
definitely pass upon the validity of legislation must
be answered without delay. Some of Marshall's associates
on the Supreme Bench were becoming old
and feeble, and death, or resignation enforced by
illness, was likely at any moment to break the Nationalist
solidarity of the Supreme Court;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> and the
appointing power had fallen into the hands of the
man who held the subjugation of the National Judiciary
as one of his chief purposes.</p>

<p>Only second in importance to these reasons for
Marshall's determination to meet the issue was the
absolute necessity of asserting that there was one
department of the Government that could not be
influenced by temporary public opinion. The value
to a democracy of a steadying force was not then
so well understood as it is at present, but the Chief
Justice fully appreciated it and determined at all
hazards to make the National Judiciary the stabilizing
power that it has since become. It should be
said, however, that Marshall no longer "idolized
democracy," as he declared he did when as a young
man he addressed the Virginia Convention of 1788.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
On the contrary, he had come to distrust popular
rule as much as did most Federalists.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>A case was then pending before the Supreme
Court the decision of which might, by boldness and
ingenuity, be made to serve as the occasion for that
tribunal's assertion of its right and power to invalidate
acts of Congress and also for the laying-down
of rules for the guidance of all departments of the
Government. This was the case of Marbury <i>vs.</i>
Madison.</p>

<p>Just before his term expired,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> President Adams
had appointed forty-two persons to be justices of
the peace for the Counties of Washington and Alexandria
in the District of Columbia.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The Federalist
Senate had confirmed these nominations,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and
the commissions had been signed and sealed, but
had not been delivered. When Jefferson was inaugurated
he directed Madison, as Secretary of State, to
issue commissions to twenty-five of the persons appointed
by Adams, but to withhold the commissions
from the other seventeen.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Among the latter were William Marbury, Dennis
Ramsay, Robert Townsend Hooe, and William Harper.
These four men applied to the Supreme Court
for a writ of mandamus compelling Madison to
deliver their commissions. The other thirteen did
not join in the suit, apparently considering the office
of justice of the peace too insignificant to be worth
the expense of litigation. Indeed, these offices were
deemed so trifling that one of Adams's appointees to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
whom Madison delivered a commission resigned, and
five others refused to qualify.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>When the application of Marbury and his associates
came before Marshall he assumed jurisdiction,
and in December, 1801, issued the usual rule
to Madison ordering him to show cause at the next
term of the Supreme Court why the writ of mandamus
should not be awarded against him. Soon afterward,
as we have seen, Congress abolished the June
session of the Supreme Court;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> thus, when the court
again convened in February, 1803, the case of Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison was still pending.</p>

<p>Marshall resolved to make use of this unimportant
litigation to assert, at the critical hour when
such a pronouncement was essential, the power of the
Supreme Court to declare invalid acts of Congress
that violate the Constitution.</p>

<p>Considering the fact that Marshall was an experienced
politician, was intimately familiar with the
political methods of Jefferson and the Republican
leaders, and was advised of their purposes, he could
not have failed to realize the probable consequences
to himself of the bold course he now determined to
take. As the crawling months of 1802 wore on, no
signs appeared that the Republican programme for
overthrowing the independence of the Judiciary
would be relinquished or modified. On the contrary,
the coming of the new year (1803) found the second
phase of the Republican assault determined upon.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the session of 1803 the House
impeached John Pickering, Judge of the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.
In Pennsylvania, the recently elected Republican
House had impeached Judge Alexander
Addison, and his conviction by a partisan vote was
assured. Already the Republican determination to
remove Samuel Chase from the Supreme Bench was
frankly avowed.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the Republicans openly threatened to
oust Marshall and his Federalist associates in case
the court decided Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison as the Republicans
expected it would. They did not anticipate
that Marshall would declare unconstitutional
that section of the old Federalist Judiciary Act of
1789 under which the suit had been brought. Indeed,
nobody imagined that the court would do that.</p>

<p>Everybody apparently, except Marshall and the
Associate Justices, thought that the case would be
decided in Marbury's favor and that Madison
would be ordered to deliver the withheld commissions.
It was upon this supposition that the Republican
threats of impeachment were made. The Republicans
considered Marbury's suit as a Federalist
partisan maneuver and believed that the court's decision
and Marshall's opinion would be inspired by
motives of Federalist partisanship.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a particular and powerful reason for
Marshall to fear impeachment and removal from
office; for, should he be deposed, it was certain that
Jefferson would appoint Spencer Roane of Virginia
to be Chief Justice of the United States. It was
well known that Jefferson had intended to appoint
Roane upon the death of Chief Justice Ellsworth.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
But Ellsworth had resigned in time to permit Adams
to appoint Marshall as his successor and thus thwart
Jefferson's purpose. If now Marshall were removed,
Roane would be given his place.</p>

<p>Should he be succeeded by Roane, Marshall knew
that the great principles of Nationalism, to the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>rying-out
of which his life was devoted, would never
be asserted by the National Judiciary. On the contrary,
the Supreme Court would become an engine
for the destruction of every theory of government
which Marshall held dear; for a bolder, abler, and
more persistent antagonist of those principles than
Spencer Roane did not exist.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Had he become Chief
Justice those cases in which Marshall delivered opinions
that vitalized the Constitution would have been
decided in direct opposition to Marshall's views.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>But despite the peril, Marshall resolved to act.
Better to meet the issue now, come what might, than
to evade it. If he succeeded, orderly government
would be assured, the National Judiciary lifted to
its high and true place, and one element of National
disintegration suppressed, perhaps destroyed. If he
failed, the country would be in no worse case than
that to which it was rapidly tending.</p>

<p>No words in the Constitution gave the Judiciary
the power to annul legislation. The subject had
been discussed in the Convention, but the brief and
scattering debate had arisen upon the proposition to
make the President and Justices of the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Court members of a Council of Revision with power
to negative acts of Congress. No direct resolution
was ever offered to the effect that the Judiciary
should be given power to declare acts of Congress
unconstitutional. In the discussion of the proposed
Council of Revision there were sharp differences of
opinion on the collateral question of the right and
wisdom of judicial control of legislative acts.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> But,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in the end, nothing was done and the whole subject
was dropped.</p>

<p>Such was the record of the Constitutional Convention
when, by his opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison,
Marshall made the principle of judicial supremacy
over legislation as much a part of our fundamental
law as if the Constitution contained these specific
words: the Supreme Court shall have the power to
declare invalid any act of Congress which, in the
opinion of the court, is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In establishing this principle Marshall was to contribute
nothing new to the thought upon the subject.
All the arguments on both sides of the question
had been made over and over again since the Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions had startled the
land, and had been freshly stated in the Judiciary
debate in the preceding Congress. Members of the
Federalist majority in most of the State Legislatures
had expressed, in highly colored partisan rhetoric,
every sound reason for the theory that the National
Judiciary should be the ultimate interpreter of the
Constitution. Both Federalist and Republican newspapers
had printed scores of essays for and against
that doctrine.</p>

<p>In the Virginia Convention of 1788 Marshall had
announced as a fundamental principle that if Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>gress
should pass an unconstitutional law the courts
would declare it void,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and in his reply to the address
of the majority of the Virginia Legislature<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> he had
elaborately, though with much caution and some
mistiness, set forth his views.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Chief Justice Jay and
his associates had complained that the Judiciary
Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, but they had not
had the courage to announce that opinion from the
Bench.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Justices Iredell and Paterson, sitting as
circuit judges, had claimed for the National Judiciary
the exclusive right to determine the constitutionality
of laws. Chief Justice Jay in charging a
grand jury, and Associate Justice Wilson in a carefully
prepared law lecture, had announced the same
conclusion.</p>

<p>Various State judges of the Federalist faith,
among them Dana of Massachusetts and Addison of
Pennsylvania, had spoken to like effect. At the trial
of Callender<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Marshall had heard Chase deliver the
opinion that the National Judiciary had the exclusive
power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
Jefferson himself had written Meusnier, the
year before the National Constitution was framed,
that the Virginia Legislature had passed unconstitutional
laws,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> adding: "I have not heard that in
the other states they have ever infringed their con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>stitution;
... <i>as the judges would consider any law as
void</i> which was contrary to the constitution."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Just as Jefferson, in writing the Declaration of Independence,
put on paper not a single new or original
idea, but merely set down in clear and compact form
what had been said many times before,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> so Marshall,
in his opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, did nothing
more than restate that which had previously been
declared by hundreds of men. Thomas Jefferson and
John Marshall as private citizens in Charlottesville
and Richmond might have written Declarations and
Opinions all their lives, and to-day none but the
curious student would know that such men had ever
lived. It was the authoritative position which these
two great Americans happened to occupy and the
compelling emergency for the announcement of the
principles they expressed, as well as the soundness
of those principles, that have given immortality to
their enunciations.</p>

<p>Learned men have made exhaustive research for
legal decisions by which Marshall's footsteps may
have been guided, or which, at least, would justify
his conclusion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The cases
thus discovered are curious and interesting, but it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
probable that Marshall had not heard of many of
them. At any rate, he does not cite one of them in
the course of this opinion, although no case ever
was decided in which a judge needed so much the
support of judicial precedents. Neither did he know
anything whatever of what was said on the subject
in the Constitutional Convention, unless by hearsay,
for its sessions were secret<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and the Journals
were not made public until 1819&mdash;thirty years
after the Government was established, and sixteen
years after Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison was decided.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Nor
was Marshall informed of the discussions of the
subject in the State Conventions that ratified the
Constitution, except of those that took place in
the Virginia Convention.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, he surely had read the Judiciary
debate in Congress, for he was in the Capital when
that controversy took place and the speeches were
fully reported in the Washington press. Marshall
probably was present in the Senate and the House
when the most notable arguments were made.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
More important, however, than written decisions or
printed debates in influencing Marshall's mind was
<i>The Federalist</i>, which we know he read carefully. In
number seventy-eight of that work, Hamilton stated
the principle of judicial supremacy which Marshall
whole-heartedly adopted in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"The interpretation of the laws," wrote Hamilton,
"is the proper and peculiar province of the
courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded
by the judges, as a fundamental law. It
therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning,
as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding
from the legislative body. If there should
happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the
two, ... the Constitution ought to be preferred to
the statute, the intention of the people to the intention
of their agents."<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>In this passage Hamilton merely stated the general
understanding of nearly all the important framers
of the Constitution. Beyond question, Marshall
considered that principle to have been woven into
the very fiber of the Nation's fundamental law.</p>

<p>In executing his carefully determined purpose to
have the Supreme Court formally announce the exclusive
power of that tribunal as the authority of
last resort to interpret the Constitution and determine
the validity of laws by the test of that instrument,
Marshall faced two practical and baffling
difficulties, in addition to those larger and more
forbidding ones which we have already considered.</p>

<p>The first of these was the condition of the Supreme
Court itself and the low place it held in the
public esteem; from the beginning it had not, as a
body, impressed the public mind with its wisdom,
dignity, or force.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The second obstacle was techni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>cal
and immediate. Just how should Marshall declare
the Supreme Court to be the ultimate arbiter
of conflicts between statutes and the Constitution?
What occasion could he find to justify, and seemingly
to require, the pronouncement as the judgment
of the Supreme Court of that opinion now
imperatively demanded, and which he had resolved
at all hazards to deliver?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Republicans repealed the Federalist
Judiciary Act of 1801, Marshall had actually proposed
to his associates upon the Supreme Bench
that they refuse to sit as circuit judges, and "risk
the consequences." By the Constitution, he said,
they were Judges of the Supreme Court only; their
commissions proved that they were appointed solely
to those offices; the section requiring them to sit in
inferior courts was unconstitutional. The other
members of the Supreme Court, however, had not
the courage to adopt the heroic course Marshall
recommended. They agreed that his views were
sound, but insisted that, because the Ellsworth
Judiciary Act had been acquiesced in since the adoption
of the Constitution, the validity of that act
must now be considered as established.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> So Marshall
reluctantly abandoned his bold plan, and in
the autumn of 1802 held court at Richmond as circuit
judge. To the end of his life, however, he held
firmly to the opinion that in so far as the Republican
Judiciary Repeal Act of 1802 deprived National
judges of their offices and salaries, that legislation
was unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Had the circuit judges, whose offices had just been
taken from them, resisted in the courts, Marshall
might, and probably would, have seized upon the
issue thus presented to declare invalid the act by
which the Republicans had overturned the new
Federalist Judiciary system. Just this, as we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
seen, the Republicans had expected him to do, and
therefore had so changed the sessions of the Supreme
Court that it could not render any decision for more
than a year after the new Federalist courts were
abolished.</p>

<p>Certain of the deposed National judges had, indeed,
taken steps to bring the "revolutionary" Republican
measure before the Supreme Court,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> but
their energies flagged, their hearts failed, and their
only action was a futile and foolish protest to the
very Congress that had wrested their judicial seats
from under them.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Marshall was thus deprived of
that opportunity at the only time he could have
availed himself of it.</p>

<p>A year afterward, when Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison
came up for decision, the entire National Judiciary
had submitted to the Republican repeal and was
holding court under the Act of 1789.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> This case,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
then, alone remained as the only possible occasion
for announcing, at that critical time, the supervisory
power of the Judiciary over legislation.</p>

<p>Marshall was Secretary of State when President
Adams tardily appointed, and the Federalist Senate
confirmed, the forty-two justices of the peace for the
District of Columbia,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> and it was Marshall who had
failed to deliver the commissions to the appointees.
Instead, he had, with his customary negligence of
details, left them on his desk. Scarcely had he arrived
at Richmond, after Jefferson's inauguration,
when his brother, James M. Marshall, wrote him of
the plight in which the newly appointed justices
of the peace found themselves as the result of Marshall's
oversight.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice replied: "I learn with infinite
chagrin the 'development of principle' mentioned in
yours of the 12th,"&mdash;sarcastically referring to the
Administration's conduct toward the Judiciary,&mdash;"&amp;
I cannot help regreting it the more as I fear some
blame may be imputed to me....</p>

<p>"I did not send out the commissions because I apprehended
such as were for a fixed time to be completed
when signed &amp; sealed &amp; such as depended on
the will of the President might at any time be revoked.
To withhold the commission of the Marshal
is equal to displacing him which the President, I
presume, has the power to do, but to withhold the
commissions of the Justices is an act of which I entertaind
no suspicion. I should however have sent
out the commissions which had been signed &amp; sealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
but for the extreme hurry of the time &amp; the absence
of Mr. Wagner [Clerk of the State Department]
who had been called on by the President to act as his
private secretary."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, it thus appears, was thoroughly familiar
with the matter when the application of Marbury
and his three associates came before the Supreme
Court, and took in it a keen and personal interest.
By the time<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> the case came on for final disposition
the term had almost half expired for which Marbury
and his associates had been appointed. The other
justices of the peace to whom Madison had delivered
commissions were then transacting all the business
that required the attention of such officials.
It was certain, moreover, that the Administration
would not recognize Marbury and his associates, no
matter what Marshall might decide. In fact, these
appointees must have lost all interest in the contest
for offices of such slight dignity and such insignificant
emoluments.</p>

<p>So far, then, as practical results were concerned,
the case of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison had now come to
the point where it was of no consequence whatever
to any one. It presented only theoretical questions,
and, on the face of the record, even these were as
simple as they were unimportant. This controversy,
in fact, had degenerated into little more than "a moot
case," as Jefferson termed it twenty years later.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>At the hearing it was proved that the commissions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
had been signed and sealed. One witness was Marshall's
brother, James M. Marshall. Jefferson's
Attorney-General, Levi Lincoln, was excused from
testifying as to what finally became of them. Madison
refused to show cause and denied, by utterly
ignoring, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to
direct or control him in his administration of the
office of Secretary of State.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Charles Lee, former Attorney-General, counsel for
the applicants, argued the questions which he and
everybody else thought were involved. He maintained
that a mandamus was the proper remedy,
made so not only by the nature of the relation of the
Supreme Court to inferior courts and ministerial
officers, but by positive enactment of Congress in
the Judiciary Law of 1789. Lee pointed out that
the Supreme Court had acted on this authority in
two previous cases.</p>

<p>Apparently the court could do one or the other
of two things: it could disavow its power over any
branch of the Executive Department and dismiss the
application, or it could assert this power in cases like
the one before it and command Madison to deliver
the withheld commissions. It was the latter course
that the Republicans expected Marshall to take.</p>

<p>If the Chief Justice should do this, Madison
undoubtedly would ignore the writ and decline to
obey the court's mandate. Thus the Executive and
Judicial Departments would have been brought into
direct conflict, with every practical advantage in
the hands of the Administration. The court had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
physical means to compel the execution of its order.
Jefferson would have denounced the illegality of
such a decision and laughed at the court's predicament.
In short, had the writ to Madison been issued,
the court would have been powerless to enforce
obedience to its own mandate.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, the court dismissed the case,
the Republican doctrines that the National courts
could not direct executives to obey the laws, and
that the Judiciary could not invalidate acts of Congress,
would by acquiescence have been admitted.</p>

<p>No matter which horn of the dilemma Marshall
selected, it was hard to see how his views could
escape impalement. He chose neither. Instead of
allowing his cherished purpose of establishing the
principle of supervisory power of the Judiciary over
legislation to be thus wounded and perhaps fatally
injured, he made the decision of this insignificant
case&mdash;about which the applicants themselves no
longer cared&mdash;the occasion for asserting that principle.
And he did assert that principle&mdash;asserted it
so impressively that for more than a century his conclusion
has easily withstood repeated assaults upon
it, which still continue.</p>

<p>Marshall accomplished his purpose by convincing
the Associate Justices of the unconstitutionality of
that section of the Ellsworth Judiciary Act of 1789<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which expressly conferred upon the Supreme Court
the power to issue writs of mandamus and prohibition,
and in persuading them to allow him to announce
that conclusion as the opinion of the court.
When we consider that, while all the Justices agreed
with Marshall that the provision of the Ellsworth
Judiciary Law requiring them to sit as circuit judges
was unconstitutional, and yet refused to act upon
that belief as Marshall wanted them to act, we can
realize the measure of his triumph in inducing the
same men to hold unconstitutional another provision
of the same act&mdash;a provision, too, even less open
to objection than the one they had sustained.</p>

<p>The theory of the Chief Justice that Section 13
of the old Judiciary Law was unconstitutional was
absolutely new, and it was as daring as it was novel.
It was the only original idea that Marshall contributed
to the entire controversy. Nobody ever
had questioned the validity of that section of the
statute which Marshall now challenged. Ellsworth,
who preceded Marshall as Chief Justice, had drawn
the act when he was Senator in the First Congress;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
he was one of the greatest lawyers of his time and
an influential member of the Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p>One of Marshall's associates on the Supreme
Bench at that very moment, William Paterson, had
also been, with Ellsworth, a member of the Senate
Committee that reported the Judiciary Act of 1789,
and he, too, had been a member of the Constitutional
Convention. Senators Gouverneur Morris of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
New York, William S. Johnson of Connecticut,
Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, William Few of
Georgia, George Read and Richard Bassett of Delaware,
and Caleb Strong of Massachusetts supported
the Ellsworth Law when the Senate passed it; and
in the House James Madison and George Wythe of
Virginia, Abraham Baldwin of Georgia, and Roger
Sherman of Connecticut heartily favored and voted
for the act. Most of these men were thorough lawyers,
and every one of them had also helped to draft
the National Constitution. Here were twelve men,
many of them highly learned in the law, makers of
the Constitution, draftsmen or advocates and supporters
of the Ellsworth Judiciary Act of 1789, not
one of whom had ever dreamed that an important
section of that law was unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, from the organization of the Supreme
Court to that moment, the bench and bar had
accepted it, and the Justices of the Supreme Court,
sitting with National district judges, had recognized
its authority when called upon to take action in a
particular controversy brought directly under it.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
The Supreme Court itself had held that it had jurisdiction,
under Section 13, to issue a mandamus in a
proper case,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and had granted a writ of prohibition
by authority of the same section.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> In two other
cases this section had come before the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Court, and no one had even intimated that it was
unconstitutional.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>When, to his great disgust, Marshall was forced
to sit as a circuit judge at Richmond in the winter of
1802, a case came before him that involved both the
validity of the Republican Repeal Act and also the
constitutionality of that provision of the Ellsworth
Judiciary Law requiring justices of the Supreme
Court to sit as circuit judges. This was the case of
Stuart <i>vs.</i> Laird. Marshall held merely that the plea
which raised these questions was insufficient, and
the case was taken to the Supreme Court on a writ
of error. After extended argument Justice Paterson
delivered the opinion of the court, Marshall declining
to participate in the decision because he had
"tried the cause in the court below."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>At the same term, then, at which Marbury <i>vs.</i>
Madison was decided, and immediately after Marshall's
opinion in that case was delivered, all the
justices of the Supreme Court except the Chief Justice,
held "that practice and acquiescence under it
[the Judiciary Act of 1789] for a period of several
years, commencing with the organization of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
judicial system ... has fixed the construction. It is
a contemporary interpretation of the most forcible
nature. This practical exposition is too strong and
obstinate to be shaken or controlled. Of course, the
question is at rest, and ought not now to be disturbed."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>But the exigency disclosed in this chapter required
immediate action, notwithstanding the obstacles
above set forth. The issue raised by the
Republicans&mdash;the free hand of Congress, unrestrained
by courts&mdash;must be settled at that time or
be abandoned perhaps forever. The fundamental
consideration involved must have a prompt, firm,
and, if possible, final answer. Were such an answer
not then given, it was not certain that it could ever
be made. As it turned out, but for Marbury <i>vs.</i>
Madison, the power of the Supreme Court to annul
acts of Congress probably would not have been
insisted upon thereafter. For, during the thirty-two
years that Marshall remained on the Supreme
Bench after the decision of that case, and for twenty
years after his death, no case came before the court
where an act of Congress was overthrown; and
none had been invalidated from the adoption of the
Constitution to the day when Marshall delivered his
epochal opinion. So that, as a matter of historical
significance, had he not then taken this stand,
nearly seventy years would have passed without
any question arising as to the omnipotence of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
After so long a period of judicial acquiescence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
in Congressional supremacy it seems likely that opposition
to it would have been futile.</p>

<p>For the reasons stated, Marshall resolved to take
that step which, for courage, statesmanlike foresight,
and, indeed, for perfectly calculated audacity,
has few parallels in judicial history. In order to
assert that in the Judiciary rested the exclusive
power<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> to declare any statute unconstitutional, and
to announce that the Supreme Court was the ultimate
arbiter as to what is and what is not law
under the Constitution, Marshall determined to annul
Section 13 of the Ellsworth Judiciary Act of
1789. In taking such a step the Chief Justice made
up his mind that he would sum up in final and
conclusive form the reasoning that sustained that
principle.</p>

<p>Marshall resolved to go still further. He would
announce from the Supreme Bench rules of procedure
which the Executive branch of the Government
must observe. This was indispensable, he correctly
thought, if the departments were to be harmonious
branches of a single and National Government,
rather than warring factions whose dissensions must
in the end paralyze the administration of the Nation's
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not, then, Marshall's declaring an act of
Congress to be unconstitutional that was innovating
or revolutionary. The extraordinary thing was
the pretext he devised for rendering that opinion&mdash;a
pretext which, it cannot be too often recalled, had
been unheard of and unsuspected hitherto. Nothing
but the emergency compelling the insistence, at this
particular time, that the Supreme Court has such
a power, can fully and satisfactorily explain the
action of Marshall in holding this section void.</p>

<p>In his opinion the Chief Justice spoke of "the
peculiar delicacy of this case, the novelty of some of
its circumstances, and the real difficulty attending
the points which occur in it."<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> He would follow, he
said, the points of counsel in the order in which
they had been made.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Did the applicants have a
right to the commissions? This depended, he said,
on whether Marbury had been appointed to office.
If so, he was entitled to the commission which was
merely the formal evidence of the appointment.
The President had nominated him to the Senate,
the Senate had confirmed the nomination, the President
had signed the commission, and, in the manner
directed by act of Congress, the Secretary of
State had affixed to it the seal of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The President could not recall his appointment if
"the officer is not removable." Delivery of the commission
was not necessary to the consummation of
the appointment which had already been effected;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
otherwise "negligence, ... fraud, fire or theft, might
deprive an individual of his office." But the truth
was that "a copy from the record ... would be, to
every intent and purpose, equal to the original."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
The appointment of Marbury "vested in the officer
legal rights ... of his country," and "to withhold his
commission is an act ... not warranted by law, but
violative of a vested legal right....<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>"The very essence of civil liberty," continues
Marshall, "certainly consists in the right of every
individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever
he receives an injury. One of the first duties
of government is to afford that protection." Ours
has been "emphatically termed a government of
laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve
this high appellation, if the laws furnish no
remedy for the violation of a vested legal right....<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>"The act of delivering or withholding a commission"
is not "a mere political act, belonging to the
executive department alone," but a ministerial act,
the performance of which is directed by statute.
Congress had ordered the Secretary of War to place
the names of certain persons on the pension rolls;
suppose that he should refuse to do so? "Would the
wounded veteran be without remedy?... Is it to be
contended that the heads of departments are not
amenable to the laws of their country?"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>Would any person whatever attempt to maintain
that a purchaser of public lands could be deprived of
his property because a Secretary of State withheld
his patent?<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> To be sure, the President had certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
political powers and could appoint agents to aid him
in the exercise of them. The courts had no authority
to interfere in this sphere of Executive action. For
example, the conduct of foreign affairs by the Secretary
of State, as the representative of the President,
can never be examinable by the courts. But the
delivery of a commission to an office or a patent
to land was a different matter.</p>

<p>When Congress by statute peremptorily directs
the Secretary of State or any other officer to perform
specific duties on which "the rights of individuals
are dependent ... he cannot at his discretion sport
away the vested rights of others." If he attempts to
do so he is answerable to the courts. "The question
whether a right has vested or not, is, in its nature,
judicial, and must be tried by the judicial authority."
The court therefore was empowered to decide
the point; and held that Madison's refusal to deliver
Marbury's commission was "a plain violation of that
right, for which the laws of his country afford him a
remedy."<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>But was this remedy the writ of mandamus for
which Marbury had applied? It was, said Marshall;
but could such an order be directed to the Secretary
of State? This was a task "peculiarly irksome,
as well as delicate,"<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> for, he observed, there were
those who would at first consider it "as an attempt
to intrude into the cabinet, and to intermeddle with
the prerogatives of the executive." Far be it from
John Marshall to do such a thing. He need hardly
"disclaim all pretensions to such jurisdiction." Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
"for a moment" would he entertain "an extravagance
so absurd and excessive.... Questions in
their nature political, ... can never be made in this
court." But if the case before him presented only
questions concerning legal rights of an individual,
"what is there in the exalted station" of the Secretary
of State which "exempts him from ... being
compelled to obey the judgment of the law"? The
only remaining question, therefore, was whether a
mandamus could issue from the Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>In such manner Marshall finally arrived at the
examination of the constitutionality of Section 13,
which, he said, fitted the present case "precisely";
and "if this court is not authorized to issue a writ of
mandamus" to Madison, "it must be because the
law is unconstitutional, and therefore absolutely incapable
of conferring the authority."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> In reaching
this point Marshall employs almost seven thousand
words. Fifteen hundred more words are used before
he takes up the principle of judicial supremacy over
legislation.</p>

<p>The fundamental law of the Nation, Marshall explained,
expressly defined the original jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court and carefully limited its authority.
It could take original cognizance only of specific
cases. In all others, the court was given nothing
but "appellate jurisdiction." But he omitted the
words that immediately follow in the same sentence&mdash;"with
such exceptions ... as the Congress shall
make." Yet this language had, for fourteen years,
apparently been considered by the whole bench and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
bar as meaning, among other things, that while Congress
could <i>not take from</i> the Supreme Court original
jurisdiction in the cases specifically named in Article
Three of the Constitution, Congress <i>could add</i> other
cases to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>Marshall was quite conscious of all this, it would
seem. In the argument, counsel had insisted that
since "the clause, assigning original jurisdiction to
the Supreme Court, contains no negative or restrictive
words, the power remains to the legislature, to
assign original jurisdiction to that court in other
cases than those specified."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But, reasons Marshall,
in answer to this contention, if Congress could thus
enlarge the original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court, "the subsequent part of the section<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> is mere
surplusage, is entirely without meaning, ... is form
without substance.... Affirmative words are often
... negative of other objects than those affirmed;
and in this case, a negative or exclusive sense must
be given to them, <i>or they have no operation at all</i>."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>That is to say, when the Constitution conferred
upon the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in
specified cases, it thereby excluded all others&mdash;denied
to Congress the power to add to the jurisdiction
thus affirmatively granted. And yet, let it be repeated,
by giving original jurisdiction in cases specifically
named, the Constitution put it beyond the
power of Congress to interfere with the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Court in those cases; but Marshall asserted that
the specific grant of jurisdiction has "<i>no operation
at all</i>" unless "a negative or exclusive sense" be
given it.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Marshall boldly held, therefore, that Section 13 of
the Ellsworth Judiciary Act was "not warranted by
the Constitution." Such being the case, ought the
Supreme Court to act under this unconstitutional
section? As the Chief Justice stated the question,
could "an act, repugnant to the constitution ... become
the law of the land"? After writing nearly
nine thousand words, he now reached the commanding
question: Can the Supreme Court of the United
States invalidate an act which Congress has passed
and the President has approved?</p>

<p>Marshall avowed that the Supreme Court can
and must do that very thing, and in so doing made
Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison historic. In this, the vital
part of his opinion, the Chief Justice is direct, clear,
simple, and convincing. The people, he said, have
an elemental right to establish such principles for
"their future government, as ... shall most conduce
to their own happiness." This was "the basis on
which the whole American fabric had been erected."
These "permanent" and "fundamental" principles,
in the instance of the American Government, were
those limiting the powers of the various departments:
"That those limits may not be mistaken,
or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what
purpose are powers limited ... if these limits may,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
at any time, be passed by those intended to be
restrained?"<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>If Congress or any other department of the Government
can ignore the limitations of the Constitution,
all distinction between government of "limited
and unlimited powers" is done away with. To
say that "acts prohibited and acts allowed are of
equal obligation" is to deny the very purpose for
which our fundamental law was adopted. "The
constitution controls any legislative act repugnant
to it." Congress cannot alter it by legislation.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> All
this, said Marshall, was too clear to admit of discussion,
but he proceeded, nevertheless, to discuss
the subject at great length.</p>

<p>There is "no middle ground." The Constitution
is either "a superior paramount law" not to
be changed by legislative enactment, or else "it is
on a level with the ordinary legislative acts" and,
as such, "alterable" at the will of Congress. If
the Constitution is supreme, then an act of Congress
violative of it is not law; if the Constitution
is not supreme, then "written constitutions are absurd
attempts, on the part of the people, to limit
a power in its own nature illimitable." Three times
in a short space Marshall insists that, for Congress
to ignore the limitations which the Constitution
places upon it, is to deny the whole theory of government
under written constitutions.</p>

<p>Although the contention that the Judiciary must
consider unconstitutional legislation to be valid was
"an absurdity too gross to be insisted on," Marshall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
would, nevertheless, patiently examine it.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> This he
did by reasoning so simple and so logical that the
dullest citizen could not fail to understand it nor the
most astute intellect escape it. But in the process he
was tiresomely repetitious, though not to so irritating
an extent as he at times became.</p>

<p>If two laws conflict, the courts must decide between
them. Where the Constitution and an act
of Congress apply to a case, "the court must determine
which ... governs [it]. This is of the very
essence of judicial duty.... If, then, ... the constitution
is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature,"
the Judiciary must prefer it to a mere statute.
Otherwise "courts must close their eyes on the constitution,"
and see only the legislative enactment.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>But to do this "would subvert the very foundation
of all written constitutions." It would be to
"declare that an act which ... is entirely void, is
yet ... completely obligatory," and that Congress
may do "what is expressly forbidden." This would
give to the legislature "a practical and real omnipotence,
with the same breath which professes to restrict
their powers within narrow limits." It would
be "prescribing limits, and declaring that those limits
may be passed at pleasure." This "reduces to
nothing" both the letter and the theory of the Constitution.</p>

<p>That instrument expressly extends the judicial
power to cases "arising under the constitution."
Must the courts decide such a case "without examining
the instrument under which it arises?" If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
courts must look into the Constitution at all, as
assuredly they must do in some cases, "what part
of it are they forbidden to read or to obey?"</p>

<p>Marshall cites hypothetical examples of legislation
in direct conflict with the fundamental law.
Suppose that Congress should place an export duty
on cotton, tobacco, flour, and that the Government
should bring suit to recover the tax. "Ought judgment
to be rendered in such a case?" Or if a bill of
attainder should be passed and citizens prosecuted
under it, "must the court condemn to death those
victims whom the constitution endeavors to preserve?"</p>

<p>Take, for example, the crime of treason: the Constitution
emphatically prescribes that nobody can be
convicted of this offense "unless on the testimony of
two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession
in open court." The Judiciary particularly are addressed&mdash;"it
prescribes, directly for them, a rule of
evidence not to be departed from." Suppose that
Congress should enact a law providing that a citizen
might be convicted of treason upon the testimony of
one witness or by a confession out of court? Which
must the court obey&mdash;the Constitution or the act
altering that instrument?</p>

<p>Did not these illustrations and many others that
might be given prove that the Constitution must
govern courts as well as Congress? If not, why does
the Constitution require judges "to take an oath
to support it"? That solemn obligation "applies in
an especial manner to their conduct in their official
character." How "immoral" to direct them to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
this oath "if they were to be used as the instruments,
and the knowing instruments, for violating
what they swear to support!" Such contradictions
and confusions would make the ceremony of taking
the oath of judicial office "a solemn mockery" and
even "a crime."</p>

<p>There is, then, said Marshall, no escape from the
conclusion "that a law repugnant to the constitution
is void," and that the judicial as well as other
departments are bound by the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The
application of Marbury and others must therefore
be dismissed.</p>

<p>Thus, by a coup as bold in design and as daring
in execution as that by which the Constitution had
been framed,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> John Marshall set up a landmark in
American history so high that all the future could
take bearings from it, so enduring that all the shocks
the Nation was to endure could not overturn it.
Such a decision was a great event in American history.
State courts, as well as National tribunals,
thereafter fearlessly applied the principle that
Marshall announced, and the supremacy of written
constitutions over legislative acts was firmly established.</p>

<p>This principle is wholly and exclusively American.
It is America's original contribution to the science
of law.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> The assertion of it, under the conditions related
in this chapter, was the deed of a great man.
One of narrower vision and smaller courage never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
would have done what Marshall did. In his management
and decision of this case, at the time and under
the circumstances, Marshall's acts and words were
those of a statesman of the first rank.</p>

<p>His opinion gave fresh strength to the purpose
of the Republican leaders to subdue the Federalist
Judiciary. It furnished Jefferson and his radical
followers a new and concrete reason for ousting
from the National Bench, and especially from the
Supreme Court, all judges who would thus override
the will of Congress. Against himself, in particular,
Marshall had newly whetted the edge of Republican
wrath, already over-keen.</p>

<p>The trial of John Pickering, Judge of the United
States Court for the District of New Hampshire,
brought by the House before the bar of the Senate,
was now pushed with cold venomousness to what
Henry Adams calls "an infamous and certainly an
illegal conviction"; and then Marshall's associate
on the Supreme Bench, Justice Samuel Chase, was
quickly impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.
If the Republican organization could force from
its partisans in the Senate a verdict of "guilty" in
Chase's case also, Marshall's official head would be
the next to fall.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Concerning Marshall's assertion of the power of
the National Judiciary to annul acts of Congress
and to direct administrative officers in the discharge
of their legal duties, Jefferson himself said nothing
at the time. But the opinion of the Chief Justice
was another ingredient thrown into the caldron of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Jefferson's heart, where a hatred was brewed that
poisoned the great politician to his latest day.</p>

<p>Many months after the decision in the Marbury
case, Jefferson first broke his silence. "Nothing in
the Constitution has given them [the Supreme
Court] a right to decide for the Executive, more than
to the Executive to decide for them," he wrote.
"The opinion which gives to the judges the right to
decide what laws are constitutional, and what not,
not only for themselves in their own sphere of
action, but for the Legislature &amp; Executive also, in
their spheres, would make the judiciary a despotic
branch."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Again, during the trial of Aaron Burr,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Jefferson
denounced Marshall for his opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i>
Madison; and toward the close of his life he returned
again and again with corroding words to the subject
regarding which, at the moment it arose, he concealed,
so far as written words were concerned, his
virulent resentment. For instance, seventeen years
later Jefferson wrote that "to consider the judges
as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions
... would place us under the despotism of an
oligarchy."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>But for the time being, Jefferson was quiescent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
His subtle mind knew how, in political controversies,
to control his tongue and pen. It could do no
good for him, personally, to make an outcry now;
and it might do harm. The doctrine which Marshall
announced had, Jefferson knew, a strong hold on all
Federalists, and, indeed, on many Northern Republicans;
the bar, especially, upheld it generally.</p>

<p>The Presidential campaign was drawing near, and
for the President openly to attack Marshall's position
would create a political issue which could win
none to the Republican cause not already fighting
for it, and might keep recruits from joining the Republican
colors. Jefferson was infinitely concerned
about his re&euml;lection and was giving practical attention
to the strengthening of his party for the approaching
contest.</p>

<p>"I am decidedly in favor of making all the banks
Republican, by sharing deposits among them in proportion
to the [political] dispositions they show," he
wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury three months
after Marshall's bold assertion of the dignity and
power of the National courts. "It is," he continued,
"material to the safety of Republicanism to
detach the mercantile interests from its enemies and
incorporate them into the body of its friends."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, Jefferson was, at that particular
moment, profoundly troubled by intimate personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
matters and vast National complications. He had
been trying, unsuccessfully, to adjust our dispute
with France; the radical West was becoming clamorous
for a forward and even a militant policy concerning
the control of the Mississippi River, and especially
of New Orleans, which commanded the mouth
of that commercial waterway; while the Federalists,
insisting upon bold measures, had a fair prospect of
winning from Jefferson's support those aggressive
and predatory frontiersmen who, until now, had
stanchly upheld the Republican standard.</p>

<p>Spain had ceded Louisiana to France upon the
condition that the territory never should be transferred
to any other government; but neither New
Orleans nor any part of Louisiana had actually been
surrendered by the Spanish authorities. Great
Britain informed the American Government that
she would not consent to the occupation by the
French of any part of Spain's possessions on the
American continent.</p>

<p>Hating and distrusting the British, but also in
terror of Napoleon, Jefferson, who was as weak in
the conduct of foreign affairs as he was dexterous
in the management of political parties, thought to
escape the predicament by purchasing the island of
Orleans and perhaps a strip on the east side of the
Mississippi River.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>A series of events swiftly followed the decision of
Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison which enthralled the eager
attention of the whole people and changed the destiny
of the Republic. Three months after Marshall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
delivered his opinion, Napoleon, yielding to "the
empire of circumstances," as Talleyrand phrased it,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
offered, and Livingston and Monroe accepted, the
whole of Louisiana for less than fifteen million dollars.
Of course France had no title to sell&mdash;Louisiana
was still legally owned and actually occupied
by Spain. The United States bought nothing more
than a pretension; and, by force of propinquity and
power, made it a fact.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The President was amazed when the news reached
him. He did not want Louisiana<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>&mdash;nothing was
further from his mind than the purchase of it.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The
immorality of the acquisition affected him not at
all; but the inconvenience did. He did not know
what to do with Louisiana. Worse still, the treaty
of cession required that the people living in that
territory should be admitted into the Union, "according
to the principles of the Federal Constitution."</p>

<p>So, to his infinite disgust, Jefferson was forced to
deal with the Louisiana Purchase by methods as
vigorous as any ever advocated by the abhorred
Hamilton&mdash;methods more autocratic than those
which, when done by others, he had savagely denounced
as unconstitutional and destructive of liberty.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
The President doubted whether, under the
Constitution, we could acquire, and was sure that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
could not govern, Louisiana, and he actually prepared
amendments authorizing the incorporation
into the Republic of the purchased territory.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> No
such legal mistiness dimmed the eyes of John Marshall
who, in time, was to announce as the decision
of the Supreme Court that the Republic could acquire
territory with as much right as any monarchical
government.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>To add to his perturbations, the high priest of
popular rights found himself compelled to abandon
his adored phrase, "the consent of the governed,"
upon which he had so carefully erected the structure
of his popularity, and to drive through Congress a
form of government over the people of Louisiana
without consulting their wishes in the least.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>The Jeffersonian doctrine had been that the Union
was merely a compact between sovereign States, and
that new territory and alien peoples could not be
added to it without the consent of all the partners.
The Federalists now took their stand upon this
indefensible ground,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and openly threatened the
secession at which they had hinted when the Federalist
Judiciary Act was repealed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Jefferson was alive to the danger: "Whatever
Congress shall think it necessary to do [about Louisiana],"
he cautioned one of the Republican House
leaders, "should be done with as little debate as
possible."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> A month earlier he wrote: "The Constitution
has made no provision for our holding foreign
territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations
into our Union. The Executive ... have done
an act beyond the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, he declared, "the less we say about
constitutional difficulties respecting Louisiana the
better ... What is necessary for surmounting them
must be done sub-silentio."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> The great radical favored
publicity in affairs of state only when such a
course was helpful to his political plans. On other
occasions no autocrat was ever more secretive than
Thomas Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Seemingly, however, the President
was concerned only with his influence on the
destiny of the world.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>At first the Federalist leaders were too dazed to do
more than grumble. "The cession of Louisiana ... is
like selling us a Ship after she is surrounded by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
British Fleet," shrewdly observed George Cabot,
when the news was published in Boston.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Fisher
Ames, of course, thought that "the acquiring of
territory by money is mean and despicable," especially
when done by Republicans. "The less of it
[territory] the better.... By adding an unmeasured
world beyond that river [Mississippi], we rush like
a comet into infinite space."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Soon, however, their dissatisfaction blew into
flame the embers of secession which never had become
cold in their bosoms. "I am convinced,"
wrote Uriah Tracy, "that the accession of Louisiana
will accelerate a division of these States; whose
whenabouts is uncertain, but somewhen is inevitable."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
Senator Plumer thought that the Eastern
States should form a new nation: "Adopt this western
world into the Union," he said, "and you destroy
at once the weight and importance of the Eastern
States, and compel them to establish a separate
and independent empire."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> A few days' reflection
brought Ames to the conclusion that "our country
is too big for union, too sordid for patriotism, too
democratic for liberty."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Tapping Reeve of Connecticut
made careful inquiry among the Federalists
in his vicinity and informed Tracy that "all ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
believe that we must separate, and that this is the
most favorable moment."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>Louisiana, however, was not the only motive of
the foremost New England Federalists for their
scheme of breaking up the Republic. As we have
seen, the threat of secession was repeatedly made
during the Republican assault on the Judiciary; and
now, as a fundamental cause for disunion, the
Northern Federalists speedily harked back to Jefferson's
purpose of subverting the National courts.
The Republicans were ruling the Nation, Virginia
was ruling the Republicans, Jefferson was ruling
all. Louisiana would permanently turn the balance
against the Northern and Eastern States, already
outweighed in the National scales; and the conquest
of the National Judiciary would remove from that
section its last protection against the pillaging hands
of the Huns and Vandals of Republicanism. So reasoned
the Federalists.</p>

<p>What could be done to save the rights and the
property of "the wise, the rich and the good"? By
what pathway could the chosen escape their doom?
"The principles of our Revolution point to the remedy,"
declared the soured and flint-hearted Pickering.
"The independence of the judges is now directly
assailed.... I am not willing to be sacrificed
by such popular tyrants.... I do not believe in the
practicability of a long-continued union."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>For the same reasons, Roger Griswold of Connecticut
avowed that "there can be no safety to the
Northern States <i>without a separation from the confederacy</i>."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
The Reverend Jedediah Morse of New
Hampshire wrote Senator Plumer that "our empire
... must ... break in pieces. Some think the sooner
the better."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> And the New Hampshire Senator replied:
"I hope the time is not far distant when ...
the sound part will separate from the corrupt."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of John Adams, only one eminent
New England Federalist kept his head steady
and his patriotism undefiled: George Cabot, while
sympathizing with his ancient party friends, frankly
opposed their mad project. Holding that secession
was impracticable, he declared: "I am not satisfied
that the thing itself is to be desired. My habitual
opinions have been always strongly against it."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>But the expressions of such men as Pickering,
Ames, and Griswold indicated the current of New
England Federalist thought and comment. Their
secession sentiment, however, did not appeal to the
young men, who hailed with joy the opportunity to
occupy these new, strange lands which accident,
or Providence, or Jefferson had opened to them.
Knowledge of this was indeed one cause of the anger
of some Federalist managers who owned immense
tracts in New England and in the Ohio Valley and
wanted them purchased and settled by those now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
turning their eyes to the alluring farther western
country.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> They saw with something like fury the
shifting of political power to the South and West.</p>

<p>The management of the unwelcome Louisiana
windfall, the conduct of the National campaign, the
alarming reports from New England, left Jefferson
no time to rail at Marshall or to attack that "subtle
corps of sappers and miners" who were then beginning
"to undermine ... our confederated fabric," as
Jefferson declared seventeen years later.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> For the
present the great public duty of exposing Marshall's
decision in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison must be deferred.</p>

<p>But the mills of democracy were grinding, and
after he was re&euml;lected certain impeachments would
be found in the grist that would make all right.
The defiant Marshall would at least be humbled,
perhaps&mdash;probably&mdash;removed from office. But all
in good time! For the present Jefferson had other
work to do. He himself must now exercise powers
which, according to his philosophy and declarations,
were far beyond those conferred upon him by the
Constitution.</p>

<p>So it came about that the first of Marshall's great
Constitutional opinions received scant notice at the
time of its delivery. The newspapers had little to
say about it. Even the bench and the bar of the
country, at least in the sections remote from Washington,
appear not to have heard of it,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> or, if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
had, to have forgotten it amid the thrilling events
that filled the times.</p>

<p>Because popular interest had veered toward and
was concentrated upon the Louisiana Purchase and
the renewal of war in Europe, Republican newspapers,
until then so alert to discover and eager
to attack every judicial "usurpation," had almost
nothing to say of Marshall's daring assertion of judicial
supremacy which later was execrated as the
very parent of Constitutional evil. An empire had
been won under Jefferson; therefore Jefferson had
won it&mdash;another proof of the far-seeing statesmanship
of "The Man of the People." Of consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
he must be re&euml;lected. Such was the popular logic;
and re&euml;lected Jefferson was&mdash;triumphantly, almost
unanimously.</p>

<p>Circumstances which had shackled his hands now
suddenly freed them. Henceforth the President
could do as he liked, both personally and politically.
No longer should John Marshall, the abominated
head of the National Judiciary, rest easy on the
bench which his audacity had elevated above President
and Congress. The opinion of the "usurping"
Chief Justice in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison should have
answer at last. So on with the impeachment trial
of Samuel Chase! Let him be deposed, and then, if
Marshall would not bend the knee, that obdurate
judicial defender of Nationalism should follow Chase
into desuetude and disgrace.</p>

<p>The incessant clamor of the Federalist past-statesmen,
unheard by the popular ear, had nevertheless
done some good&mdash;all the good it ought to have
done. It had aroused misgivings in the minds of
certain Northern Republican Senators as to the expediency,
wisdom, and justice of the Republican
plan to shackle or overthrow the National Judiciary.
This hesitation was, however, unknown to the masters
of the Republican organization in Congress.
The Federalists themselves were totally unaware of
it. Only Jefferson, with his abnormal sensibility,
had an indistinct impression that somewhere, in
the apparently perfect alignment of the Republican
forces, there was potential weakness.</p>

<p>Marshall was gifted with no such divination. He
knew only the fate that had been prepared for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
A crisis was reached in his career and a determinative
phase of American history entered upon. His
place as Chief Justice was to be made secure and
the stability of American institutions saved by as
narrow a margin as that by which the National
Constitution had been established.</p>

not to <i>State Legislatures</i> to decide on the constitutionality of laws
made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested
in the <i>Judiciary Courts of the Union</i>." (<i>Records of Governor and Council
of Vermont</i>, <span class="smcap">iv</span>, 529.)
</p><p>
The Federalist majority in the Maryland Legislature asserted that
"no state government ... is competent to declare an act of the federal
government unconstitutional, ... that jurisdiction ... is exclusively
vested in the courts of the United States." (Anderson, in <i>Am. Hist.
Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">v</span>, 248.)
</p><p>
The New York Federalists were slow to act, but finally resolved
"that the right of deciding on the constitutionality of all laws passed
by Congress ... appertains to the judiciary department." (<i>Ib.</i> 248-49.)
</p><p>
Connecticut Federalists declared that the Kentucky and Virginia
plan was "hostile to the existence of our national Union." (<i>Ib.</i> 247.)
</p><p>
In Delaware the then dominant party decided that the Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions were "not a fit subject" for their consideration.
(<i>Ib.</i> 246.)
</p><p>
The Pennsylvania Federalist majority resolved that the people
"have committed to the supreme judiciary of the nation the high authority
of ultimately and conclusively deciding the constitutionality
of all legislative acts." (Anderson, in <i>Am. Hist. Rev.</i> <span class="smcap">v</span>, 245.)
</p><p>
On February 8, 1799, Massachusetts replied to the Virginia Resolutions
that: "This legislature are persuaded that the decision of all
cases in law or equity, arising under the Constitution of the United
States, and the construction of all laws made in pursuance thereof,
are exclusively vested by the people in the Judicial Courts of the
U. States." (<i>Mass. Senate Journal, 1798-99</i>, <span class="smcap">xix</span>, 238, MS. volume
Mass. State Library.)
</p><p>
Such was the general tenor of the Federalists' pronouncements upon
this grave problem. But because the people believed the Sedition
Law to be directed against free speech, the Federalist supremacy in
many of the States that insisted upon these sound Nationalist principles
was soon overthrown.
</p><p>
The resolutions of the Republican minorities in the Legislatures of
the Federalist States were emphatic assertions that any State might
declare an act of Congress unconstitutional and disregard it, and <i>that
the National Judiciary did not have supervisory power over
legislation</i>.</p></div>

press. For example, just before Marshall delivered his opinion, a correspondent
of the <i>Independent Chronicle</i> of Boston sent from Washington
this article:
</p><p>
"The efforts of <i>federalism</i> to exalt the Judiciary over the Executive
and Legislature, and to give that favorite department a political character
&amp; influence, may operate for a time to come, as it has already,
to the promotion of one party and the depression of the other; but
will probably terminate in the degradation and disgrace of the Judiciary.
</p><p>
"Politics are more improper and dangerous in a Court of Justice, if
possible, than in the pulpit. Political charges, prosecutions, and similar
modes of official influence, ought never to have been resorted to by
any party. The fountains of justice should be unpolluted by party
passions and prejudices.
</p><p>
"The <i>attempt</i> of the Supreme Court of the United States, by a mandamus,
to control the Executive functions, is a new experiment. It
seems to be no less than a commencement of war between the constituted
departments.
</p><p>
"The Court must be defeated and retreat from the attack; or march
on, till they incur an impeachment and removal from office. But our
<i>Republican</i> frame of Government is so firm and solid, that there is
reason to hope it will remain unshaken by the assaults of opposition,
&amp; the conflicts of interfering departments.
</p><p>
"The will of the nation, deliberately and constitutionally expressed,
must and will prevail, the predictions and exertions of <i>federal</i> monarchists
and aristocrats to the contrary notwithstanding." (<i>Independent
Chronicle</i>, March 10, 1803.)
</p><p>
Marshall's opinion was delivered February 24. It took two weeks
of fast traveling to go from Washington to Boston. Ordinary mail required
a few days longer. The article in the <i>Chronicle</i> was probably

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_334_334" id="Footnote_334_334"></a><a href="#FNanchor_334_334"><span class="label">[334]</span></a> It seems probable, however, that it was generally understood by
the leading men of the Convention that the Judiciary was to exercise
the power of invalidating unconstitutional acts of Congress. (See
Corwin: <i>Doctrine of Judicial Review</i>, 10-11; Beard: <i>Supreme Court
and the Constitution</i>, 16-18; McLaughlin: <i>The Courts, the Constitution
and Parties</i>, 32-35.)
</p><p>
In the Constitutional Convention, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts
asserted that the judicial function of expounding statutes "involved
a power of deciding on their Constitutionality." (<i>Records of
the Federal Convention of 1787</i>: Farrand, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 97.) Rufus King of Massachusetts&mdash;later
of New York&mdash;was of the same opinion. (<i>Ib.</i> 109.)
</p><p>
On the other hand, Franklin declared that "it would be improper to
put it in the power of any Man to negative a Law passed by the Legislature
because it would give him the controul of the Legislature." (<i>Ib.</i>)
</p><p>
Madison felt "that no Man would be so daring as to place a veto
on a Law that had passed with the assent of the Legislature." (<i>Ib.</i>)
Later in the debate, Madison modified his first opinion and declared
that "a law violating a constitution established by the people themselves,
would be considered by the Judges null &amp; void." (<i>Ib.</i> <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 93.)
</p><p>
George Mason of Virginia said that the Judiciary "could declare an
unconstitutional law void.... He wished the further use to be made of
the Judges of giving aid in preventing every improper law." (<i>Ib.</i> 78.)
</p><p>
Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania&mdash;afterwards of New York&mdash;dreaded
"legislative usurpations" and felt that "encroachments of
the popular branch ... ought to be guarded agst." (<i>Ib.</i> 299.)
</p><p>
Gunning Bedford, Jr., of Delaware was against any "check on the
Legislative" with two branches. (<i>Ib.</i> <span class="smcap">i</span>, 100-01.)
</p><p>
James Wilson of Pennsylvania insisted that power in the Judiciary
to declare laws unconstitutional "did not go far enough"&mdash;the
judges should also have "Revisionary power" to pass on bills in the
process of enactment. (<i>Ib.</i> <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 73.)
</p><p>
Luther Martin of Maryland had no doubt that the Judiciary had "a
negative" on unconstitutional laws. (<i>Ib.</i> 76.)
</p><p>
John Francis Mercer of Maryland "disapproved of the Doctrine
that the Judges as expositors of the Constitution should have authority
to declare a law void." (<i>Records, Fed. Conv.</i>: Farrand, 298.)
</p><p>
John Dickinson of Delaware "thought no such power ought to
exist," but was "at a loss what expedient to substitute." (<i>Ib.</i> 299.)
</p><p>
Charles Pinckney of South Carolina "opposed the interference of
the Judges in the Legislative business." (<i>Ib.</i> 298.)
</p><p>
The above is a condensed <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of all that was said in the Constitutional
Convention on this vital matter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_350_350" id="Footnote_350_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_350_350"><span class="label">[350]</span></a> John Jay had declined reappointment as Chief Justice because
among other things, he was "perfectly convinced" that the National
Judiciary was hopelessly weak. (See <i>supra</i>, 55.) The first Chief Justice
of the United States at no moment, during his occupancy of that
office, felt sure of himself or of the powers of the court. (See Jay to
his wife, <i>Jay</i>: Johnston, <span class="smcap">iii</span>, 420.) Jay had hesitated to accept the
office as Chief Justice when Washington tendered it to him in 1789,
and he had resigned it gladly in 1795 to become the Federalist candidate
for Governor of New York.
</p><p>
Washington offered the place to Patrick Henry, who refused it.
(See Henry: <i>Patrick Henry&mdash;Life, Correspondence and Speeches</i>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>,
562-63; also Tyler, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 183.) The office was submitted to William Cushing,
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and he also refused to
consider it. (Wharton: <i>State Trials</i>, 33.) So little was a place on the
Supreme Bench esteemed that John Rutledge resigned as Associate
Justice to accept the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
South Carolina. (<i>Ib.</i> 35.)
</p><p>
Jefferson considered that the government of New Orleans was "the
second office in the United States in importance." (Randal, <span class="smcap">iii</span>, 202.)
For that matter, no National office in Washington, except the Presidency,
was prized at this period. Senator Bailey of New York actually
resigned his seat in the Senate in order to accept the office of
Postmaster at New York City. (<i>Memoirs, J. Q. A.</i>: Adams, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 290.)
Edmund Randolph, when Attorney-General, deplored the weakening
of the Supreme Court, and looked forward to the time when it
should be strengthened. (Randolph to Washington, Aug. 5, 1792,
<i>Writings of George Washington</i>: Sparks, <span class="smcap">x</span>, 513.)
</p><p>
The weakness of the Supreme Court, before Marshall became Chief
Justice, is forcibly illustrated by the fact that in designing and
building the National Capitol that tribunal was entirely forgotten and
no chamber provided for it. (See Hosea Morrill Knowlton in <i>John
Marshall&mdash;Life, Character and Judicial Services</i>: Dillon, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 198-99.)
When the seat of government was transferred to Washington, the
court crept into an humble apartment in the basement beneath the
Senate Chamber.</p></div>

Writing to Wolcott, now one of the displaced National circuit
judges (Wolcott's appointment was secured by Marshall; see vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>,
559, of this work), concerning "the outrage committed by Congress on
the Constitution" (Cabot to Wolcott, Dec. 20, 1802, Lodge: <i>Cabot</i>,
328), Cabot said: "I cannot but approve the intention of your judicial
corps to unite in a memorial or remonstrance to Congress." He considered
this to be "a manifest duty" of the judges, and gave Wolcott
the arguments for their action. (Cabot to Wolcott, Oct. 21, 1802, <i>ib.</i>

in the decision of a case requiring all possible precedents like
that of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, did not so much as refer to Marshall's
opinion, although every other case that could be found was cited.
Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, long afterwards, was added in a footnote to the
printed report. (McLaughlin, 30, citing <i>Am. Law Journal</i>, old series,
<span class="smcap">ii</span>, 255-64.)
</p><p>
Marshall's opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison was first referred to by
counsel in a legal controversy in <i>Ex Parte</i> Burford, 1806 (3 Cranch,
448). Robert Goodloe Harper next cited it in his argument for Bollmann
(4 Cranch, 86; and see <i>infra</i>, chap. <span class="smcap">vii</span>). Marshall referred to it
in his opinion in that case, and Justice William Johnson commented
upon it at some length.
</p><p>
A year later Marshall's opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison was cited
by Jefferson's Attorney-General, C&aelig;sar A. Rodney. In the case <i>Ex
Parte</i> Gilchrist <i>et al. vs.</i> The Collector of the Port of Charleston, S.C.
(5 Hughes, 1), the United States Court for that circuit, consisting of
Johnson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and the Judge of the
District Court, granted a mandamus under the section of the Judiciary
Act which Marshall and the entire court had, five years before, declared
to be unconstitutional, so far as it conferred original jurisdiction
upon the Supreme Court in applications for mandamus.
</p><p>
Rodney wrote to the President a letter of earnest protest, pointing out
the fact that the court's action in the Gilchrist case was in direct antagonism
to the opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison. But Jefferson was
then so savagely attacking Marshall's rulings in the Burr trial (see
<i>infra</i>, chaps. <span class="smcap">vii</span>, <span class="smcap">viii</span>, <span class="smcap">ix</span>) that he was, at last, giving public expression of
his disapproval of the opinion of the Chief Justice in Marbury <i>vs.</i>
Madison. He did not even answer Rodney's letter.</p></div>

<h3>IMPEACHMENT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The judges of the Supreme Court must fall. Our affairs approach an important
crisis. (William Plumer.)</p>

<p>These articles contained in themselves a virtual impeachment of not only
Mr. Chase but of all the Judges of the Supreme Court.
(John Quincy Adams.)
</p>

<p>We shall bring forward such a specimen of judicial tyranny, as, I trust in
God, will never be again exhibited in our country. (John Randolph.)</p>

<p>We appear for an ancient and infirm man whose better days have been worn
out in the service of that country which now degrades him. (Joseph Hopkinson.)</p>

<p>Our property, our liberty, our lives can only be protected by independent
judges. (Luther Martin.)</p></div>


<p>"We <i>want your offices</i>, for the purpose of giving
them to men who will fill them better." In these
frank words, Senator William Branch Giles<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> of
Virginia stated one of the purposes of the Republicans
in their determined attack on the National
Judiciary. He was speaking to the recently elected
young Federalist Senator from Massachusetts, John
Quincy Adams.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>They were sitting before the blazing logs in the
wide fireplace that warmed the Senate Chamber.
John Randolph, the Republican leader of the House,
and Israel Smith, a Republican Senator from Vermont,
were also in the group. The talk was of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
approaching trial of Samuel Chase, Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States,
whom the House had impeached for high crimes and
misdemeanors. Giles and Randolph were, "with excessive
earnestness," trying to convince the doubting
Vermont Senator of the wisdom and justice of
the Republican method of ousting from the National
Bench those judges who did not agree with the views
of the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Giles scorned the idea of "an <i>independent</i> judiciary!"
The independence claimed by the National
judges was "nothing more nor less than an
attempt to establish an aristocratic despotism in
themselves." The power of the House to impeach,
and of the Senate to try, any public officer was
unlimited.</p>

<p>"If," continued Giles, "the Judges of the Supreme
Court should dare, <i>as they had done</i>, to declare acts of
Congress unconstitutional, or to send a mandamus
to the Secretary of State, <i>as they had done</i>, it was the
undoubted right of the House to impeach them, and
of the Senate to remove them for giving such opinions,
however honest or sincere they may have been
in entertaining them." He held that the Senate,
when trying an impeached officer, did not act as a
court. "Removal by impeachment was nothing
more than a declaration by Congress to this effect:
You hold dangerous opinions, and if you are suffered
to carry them into effect you will work the destruction
of the Nation."<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Thus Giles made plain the Republican objective.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Judges were to be removed for any cause that a
dominant political party considered to be sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
The National Judiciary was, in this manner, to be
made responsive to the popular will and responsible
to the representatives of the people in the House
and of the States in the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Giles, who was now Jefferson's personal representative
in the Senate,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> as he had been in the
House, bore down upon his mild but reluctant
fellow partisan from Vermont in a "manner dogmatical
and peremptory." Not only must the aggressive
and irritating Chase be stripped of his
robes, but the same fate must fall upon "all other
Judges of the Supreme Court except the one last
appointed,"<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> who, being a Republican, was secure.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>
Adams rightly concluded that the plan was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to "have swept the supreme judicial bench clean
at a stroke."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>For a long time everybody had understood that
the impeachment of Chase was only the first step
in the execution of the Republican plan to replace
with Republicans Marshall and the four Federalist
Associate Justices. "The judges of the Supreme
Court are all Federalists," wrote Pickering six
weeks before Johnson's appointment. "They stand
in the way of the ruling power.... The Judges therefore,
are, if possible, to be removed," by impeachment.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Nearly two years before, Senator William Plumer
of New Hampshire had accurately divined the Republican
plan: "The judges of the Supreme Court
must fall," he informed Jeremiah Mason. "They
are <i>denounced</i> by the Executive, as well as the
House. They must be removed; they are obnoxious
unyielding men; &amp; why should they remain to awe
&amp; embarrass the administration? Men of more
flexible nerves can be found to succeed them. Our
affairs seem to approach an important crisis."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
The Federalists rightly believed that Jefferson was
the directing mind in planning and effecting the
subjugation of the National Judiciary. That, said
Bayard, "has been an object on which Mr. Jefferson
has long been resolved, at least ever since he has
been in office."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>John Marshall especially must be overthrown.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
He had done all the things of which Giles and the
Republicans complained. He had "dared to declare
an act of Congress unconstitutional," had "dared"
to order Madison to show cause why he should not
be compelled to do his legal duty. Everybody was
at last awake to the fact that Marshall had become
the controlling spirit of the Supreme Court and of
the whole National Judiciary.</p>

<p>Every one knew, too, that he was the most determined
Nationalist in the entire country, and that
Jefferson and the Republican Party had no more
unyielding enemy than the Chief Justice. And he
had shown by his management of the Supreme
Court and by his opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison,
how powerful that tribunal could be made. The
downfall of Samuel Chase was a matter of small
importance compared with the removal of John
Marshall.</p>

<p>"They hate Marshall, Paterson, etc. worse than
they hate Chase because they are men of better
character," asserted Judge Jeremiah Smith of New
Hampshire. "To be safe in these times good men
must not only resign their offices but they must
resign their good names.... They will be obnoxious
as long as they retain <i>either</i>. If they will neither die
nor resign they give Mr J the trouble of correcting
the <i>procedure</i>.... Tell me what the judges say&mdash;are
they frightened?" he anxiously inquired of
Plumer.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Frightened they were&mdash;and very badly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
frightened. Even John Marshall, hitherto imperturbable
and dauntless, was shaken.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>In addition to his "heretical" opinion in Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison, Marshall had given the Republicans,
and Jefferson especially, another cause for complaint.
A year after the decision of that case, he had
again gone out of his way to announce from the
Supreme Bench the fallacy of Jefferson's Constitutional
views and the soundness of the Nationalist
theory. During the February term of the Supreme
Court for the year 1804, that tribunal, in the case
of the United States <i>vs.</i> Fisher,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> was called upon to
decide whether the United States was a preferred
creditor of an insolvent, under the Bankruptcy Act
of 1800, which Marshall had helped to draw.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
Among other objections, it was suggested by counsel
for Fisher, the insolvent, that the Bankruptcy Law
was unconstitutional and that the priority which
that act gave the Nation over other creditors of
the bankrupt would prevent the States from making
similar laws for their own protection.</p>

<p>But, said Marshall, this is "the necessary consequence
of the supremacy of the laws of the United
States on all subjects to which the legislative power
of the United States extends.... The Constitution
did not prohibit Congress" from enacting a bankruptcy
law and giving the Nation preference as a
creditor. On the contrary, Congress was expressly
authorized "to make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper to carry into execution the powers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
vested by the Constitution in the National Government."
To say that "no law was authorized which
was not indispensably necessary ... would produce
endless difficulties.... Congress must possess the
choice of means and must be empowered to use
any means which are, in fact, conducive to the exercise
of a power granted by the Constitution."</p>

<p>This was an emphatic denial of Jefferson's famous
opinion on the power of Congress to charter a bank,
and an outright assertion of the views of Hamilton
on that celebrated question.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The case could have
been decided without such an expression from the
court, but it presented an opportunity for a judicial
statement of liberal construction which might not
soon come again,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and Marshall availed himself of it.</p>

<p>For two years no part of the Republican plans
against the Judiciary had miscarried. Close upon
the very day when John Breckenridge in the Senate
had moved to repeal the National Judiciary Act of
1801, a petition signed by the enraged Republicans
of Alleghany County, Pennsylvania, had been sent
to the Legislature of that State, demanding the impeachment
of Alexander Addison; and almost simultaneously
with the passage of the Judiciary Repeal
Act of Congress, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives
transmitted to the State Senate articles
charging the able but arrogant Federalist judge with
high crimes and misdemeanors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Addison's trial speedily followed; and while the
evidence against him, viewed through the perspective
of history, seems trivial, the Republican Pennsylvania
Senate pronounced judgment against him
and deposed him from the bench. With notable
ability, Addison conducted his own defense. He made
a powerful speech which is a classic of conservative
philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> But his argument was unavailing. The
Republican theory, that a judge might be deposed
from office for any conduct or opinion of which the
Legislature disapproved, was ruthlessly carried out.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Almost as soon as Congress convened after the
overthrow of the obnoxious Pennsylvania Federalist
judge, the Republicans in the National House,
upon representations from Jefferson, took steps to
impeach John Pickering, Judge of the United States
Court for the District of New Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
judge had been hopelessly insane for at least three
years and, as one result of his mental and nervous
malady, had become an incurable drunkard.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> In
this condition he had refused to hear witnesses for
the Government in the case of the ship Eliza,
seized for violation of the revenue laws. He peremptorily
ordered the vessel returned to its captain,
and finally declined to allow an appeal from his
decree. All this had been done with ravings, cursings,
and crazed incoherences.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>That he was wholly incapacitated for office and
unable to perform any act requiring intelligence was
conceded by all. But the Constitution provided no
method of removing an officer who had become
insane.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> This defect, however, gave the Republicans
an ideal opportunity to put into practice their
theory that impeachment was unrestricted and
might be applied to any officer whom, for any reason,
two thirds of the Senate deemed undesirable. "If
the facts of his denying an appeal &amp; of his intoxication,
as stated in the impeachment, are proven,
that will be sufficient cause for removal without further
enquiry," asserted Jefferson when assured that
Pickering was insane, and when asked "whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
insanity was good cause for impeachment &amp; removal
from office."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>The demented judge did not, of course, appear at
his trial. Instead, a petition by his son was presented,
alleging the madness of his father, and praying
that evidence to that effect be received by the
Senate.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> This plea was stoutly resisted, and for two
days the question was debated. "The most persevering
and determined opposition is made against
having evidence and counsel to prove the man insane,"
records John Quincy Adams, "only from the
fear, that if insanity should be proved, he cannot
be convicted of <i>high crimes and misdemeanors</i> by
acts of decisive madness."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Finally the determined
Republicans proceeded to the trial of the insane
judge for high crimes and misdemeanors, evidence
of his dethroned reason to be received "in mitigation."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
In immense disgust the House managers
withdrew, because "the Senate had determined <i>to
hear evidence</i>" that the accused person was insane.
Before they returned, they publicly denounced the
Senators for their leniency; and thus Republican
discipline was restored.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson was impatient. "It will take two years
to try this impeachment," he complained to Senator
Plumer. "The Constitution ought to be altered,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
he continued, "so that the President should be
authorized to remove a Judge from office, on the
address of the two Houses."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But the exasperated
Republicans hastened the proceedings; and the trial
did not consume two weeks all told.</p>

<p>If an insane man should be condemned, "it will
not hereafter be necessary," declared Senator Samuel
Smith of Maryland, "that a man should be
guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors," the commission
of which was the only Constitutional ground
for impeachment. Senator Jonathan Dayton of New
Jersey denounced the whole proceeding as "a mere
mockery of a trial."<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Senator John Quincy Adams,
in the flurry of debate, asserted that he should
"speak until [his] mouth was stopped by force."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
Senator Nicholas of Virginia shouted "Order!
order! order!" when Samuel White of Delaware was
speaking. So furious became the altercation that a
duel seemed possible.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> No delay was permitted and,
on March 12, 1804, the demented Pickering was,
by a strictly partisan vote of 19 to 7,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> adjudged
guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<p>An incident happened which was prophetic of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
decline in the marvelous party discipline that had
kept the Republicans in Senate and House in solid
support of the plans of the leaders. Three Republican
Senators left the Chamber in order to avoid
the balloting.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> They would not adjudge an insane
man to be guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors,
but they were not yet independent enough to vote
against their party.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> This, however, did not alarm
the Republican managers. They instantly struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the next blow upon which they had determined
more than two years before. Within an hour after
John Pickering was convicted the House voted to
impeach Samuel Chase.</p>

<p>Marshall's irascible associate on the Supreme
Bench had given the Republicans a new and serious
cause for hostilities against him. In less than two
months after Marshall had delivered the unanimous
opinion of the Supreme Court in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison,
Justice Chase, in charging the grand jury at
Baltimore, denounced Republican principles and
mercilessly assailed Republican acts and purposes.</p>

<p>This judicial critic of democracy told the grand
jury that "the bulk of mankind are governed by their
passions, and not by reason.... The late alteration of
the federal judiciary ... and the recent change in our
state constitution, by the establishing of universal
suffrage, ... will ... take away all security for property
and personal liberty ... and our republican
constitution will sink into a mobocracy, the worst
of all popular governments."</p>

<p>Chase condemned "the modern doctrines by our
late reformers, that all men, in a state of society,
are entitled to enjoy equal liberty and equal rights,
[which] have brought this mighty mischief upon us";&mdash;a
mischief which he feared "will rapidly progress,
until peace and order, freedom and property, shall
be destroyed.... Will justice be impartially administered
by judges dependent on the legislature for
their ... suport? Will liberty or property be protected
or secured, by laws made by representatives
chosen by electors, who have no property in, or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
common interest with, or attachment to, the community?"<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>Burning with anger, a young Republican member
of the Maryland Legislature, John Montgomery,
who had listened to this judicial tirade, forthwith
savagely denounced Chase in the <i>Baltimore American</i>.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
He demanded that the Justice be impeached
and removed from the bench.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Montgomery hastened
to send to the President<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> a copy of the paper.</p>

<p>Jefferson promptly wrote Nicholson: "Ought this
seditious and official attack on the principles of our
Constitution, and on the proceedings of a State,
go unpunished? And, to whom so pointedly as
yourself will the public look for the necessary measures?"</p>

<p>But Jefferson was not willing to appear openly.
With that uncanny power of divining political currents
to which coarser or simpler minds were oblivious,
he was conscious of the uneasiness of Northern
Republicans over ruthless impeachment and decided
not to become personally responsible. "For myself,"
he cautioned Nicholson, "it is better that I should
not interfere."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Upon the advice of Nathaniel Macon,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Republican
Speaker of the House, Nicholson concluded that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
would be more prudent for another to take the lead.
It was well understood that he was to have Chase's
place on the Supreme Bench,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and this fact would
put him at a disadvantage if he became the central
figure in the fight against the aged Justice. The procurement
of the impeachment was, therefore, placed
in the eager hands of John Randolph, that "unusual
Phenomenon," as John Adams called him,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> whose
lust for conspicuous leadership was insatiable.</p>

<p>The Republican managers had carefully moulded
public opinion into the belief that Chase was guilty
of some monstrous crime. Months before articles
of impeachment were presented to the House, <i>ex
parte</i> statements against him were collected, published
in pamphlet form, and scattered throughout
the country. To assure wider publicity all this
"evidence" was printed in the Republican organ
at Washington. The accused Justice had, therefore,
been tried and convicted by the people before
the charges against him were even offered in the
House.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>This preparation of the popular mind accomplished,
Chase was finally impeached. Eight articles
setting forth the Republican accusations were laid
before the Senate. Chase was accused of everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of which anybody had complained since his appointment
to the Supreme Bench. His conduct at the
trials of Fries and Callender was set forth with tedious
particularity: in Delaware he had stooped "to
the level of an informer"; his charge to the grand
jury at Baltimore was an "intemperate and inflamatory
political harangue"; he had prostituted his
"high judicial character ... to the low purpose of an
electioneering partizan"; his purpose was "to
excite ... odium ... against the government."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>This curious scramble of fault-finding, which was
to turn out so fatally for the prosecution, was the
work of Randolph. When the conglomerate indictment
was drawn, no one, except perhaps Jefferson,
had the faintest idea that the Republican plan would
miscarry; Randolph's multifarious charges pleased
those in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and
Maryland who had first made them; they were so
drawn as to lay a foundation for the assault which
was to follow immediately. "These articles," wrote
John Quincy Adams, "contained in themselves a
virtual impeachment not only of Mr. Chase, but of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
all the Judges of the Supreme Court from the first
establishment of the national judiciary."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>In an extended and carefully prepared speech,
Senator Giles, who had drawn the rules governing
the conduct of the trial in the Senate, announced
the Republican view of impeachment which, he
said, "is nothing more than an enquiry, by the two
Houses of Congress, whether the office of any public
man might not be better filled by another." Adams
was convinced that "this is undoubtedly the source
and object of Mr. Chase's impeachment, and on the
same principle any officer may easily be removed at
any time."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>From the time the House took action against
Chase, the Federalists were in despair. "I think the
Judge will be removed from Office," was Senator
Plumer's opinion.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> "The event of the impeachment
is already determined," wrote Bayard before the
trial began.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Pickering was certain that Chase would
be condemned&mdash;so would any man that the House
might impeach; such "measures ... are made questions
of <i>party</i>, and therefore at all events to be carried
into effect according to the wishes of the prime
mover [Jefferson]."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>As the day of the arraignment of the impeached
Justice approached, his friends were not comforted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
by their estimate of the public temper. "Our public
... will be as tame as Mr. Randolph can desire,"
lamented Ames. "You may broil Judge Chase and
eat him, or eat him raw; it shall stir up less anger
or pity, than the Six Nations would show, if Cornplanter
or Red Jacket were refused a belt of wampum."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>When finally Chase appeared before the bar of the
Senate, he begged that the trial should be postponed
until next session, in order that he might have time
to prepare his defense. His appeal fell on remorseless
ears; the Republicans gave him only a month. But
this scant four weeks proved fatal to their purpose.
Jefferson's wise adjustment of the greatest financial
scandal in American history<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> came before the House
during this interval; and fearless, honest, but impolitic
John Randolph attacked the Administration's
compromise of the Yazoo fraud with a ferocity all
but insane in its violence. Literally screaming with
rage, he assailed Jefferson's Postmaster-General
who was lobbying on the floor of the House for
the passage of the President's Yazoo plan, and delivered
continuous philippics against that polluted
transaction out of which later came the third of
John Marshall's most notable opinions.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>In this frame of mind, nervously exhausted, physically
overwrought and troubled, the most brilliant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and effective Congressional partisan leader of our
early history came to the trial. Moreover, Randolph
had broken with the Administration and
challenged Jefferson's hitherto undisputed partisan
autocracy. This was the first public manifestation
of that schism in the Republican Party which was
never entirely healed.</p>

<p>Such was the situation on the 4th of February,
1805, when the Senate convened to hear and determine
the case of Samuel Chase, impeached by the
House for high crimes and misdemeanors, to settle
by the judgment it should render the fate of John
Marshall as Chief Justice of the United States, and
to fix forever the place of the National Judiciary in
the scheme of American government.</p>

<p>"Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!&mdash;All persons are commanded
to keep silence on pain of imprisonment,
while the grand inquest of the nation is exhibiting
to the Senate of the United States, sitting as a Court
of Impeachments, articles of impeachment against
Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>So cried the Sergeant-at-Arms of the National
Senate when, in the Chase trial, John Marshall, the
Supreme Court, and the whole National Judiciary
were called to judgment by Thomas Jefferson, on
the bleak winter day in dismal, scattered, and quarreling
Washington. An audience crowded the Senate
Chamber almost to the point of suffocation.
There were present not only the members of Senate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and House, the officers of the Executive departments,
and the men and women of the Capital's
limited society, but also scores of eminent persons
from distant parts of the country.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Among the spectators were John Marshall and the
Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, thoroughly
conscious that they, and the institution of which
they were the highest representatives, were on trial
almost as much as their imprudent, rough, and outspoken
fellow member of the Bench. It is not improbable
that they were helping to direct the defense
of Chase,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> in which, as officials, they were personally
interested, and in which, too, all their convictions
as citizens and jurists were involved.</p>

<p>Marshall, aroused, angered, and frightened by the
articles of the impeachment, had written his brother
a year before the Chase trial that they are "sufficient
to alarm the friends of a pure, and, of course,
an independent Judiciary, if, among those who rule
our land there be any of that description."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> At
the beginning of the proceedings Chase had asked
Marshall, who was then in Richmond, to write an
account of what occurred at the trial of Callender,
and Marshall promptly responded: "I instantly
applied to my brother<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> &amp; to Mr. Wickham<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> to
state their recollection of the circumstances under
which Colo. Taylors testimony was rejected.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> They
both declared that they remembred them very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
imperfectly but that they woud endeavor to recollect
what passed &amp; commit it to writing. I shall bring
it with me to Washington in february." Marshall
also promised to bring other documents.</p>

<p>"Admitting it to be true," continues Marshall,
"that on legal principles Colo. Taylors testimony
was admissible, it certainly constitutes a very extraordinary
ground for an impeachment. According
to the antient doctrine a jury finding a verdict
against the law of the case was liable to an attaint;
&amp; the amount of the present doctrine seems to be
that a Judge giving a legal opinion contrary to the
opinion of the legislature is liable to impeachment.</p>

<p>"As, for convenience &amp; humanity the old doctrine
of attaint has yielded to the silent, moderate but
not less operative influence of new trials, I think
the modern doctrine of impeachment should yield
to an appellate jurisdiction in the legislature. A reversal
of those legal opinions deemed unsound by
the legislature would certainly better comport with
the mildness of our character than [would] a removal
of the Judge who has rendered them unknowing of
his fault.</p>

<p>"The other charges except the 1st &amp; 4th which
I suppose to be altogether unfounded, seem still less
to furnish cause for impeachment. But the little
finger of [blotted out&mdash;probably "democracy"] is
heavier than the loins of &mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>"Farewell&mdash;With much respect and esteem....</p>

<p class="ralign">"<span class="smcap">J. Marshall.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall thus suggested the most radical method
for correcting judicial decisions ever advanced, before
or since, by any man of the first class. Appeals
from the Supreme Court to Congress! Senators and
Representatives to be the final judges of any judicial
decision with which a majority of the House was
dissatisfied! Had we not the evidence of Marshall's
signature to a letter written in his well-known hand,
it could not be credited that he ever entertained
such sentiments. They were in direct contradiction
to his reasoning in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, utterly
destructive of the Federalist philosophy of judicial
control of legislation.</p>

<p>The explanation is that Marshall was seriously
alarmed. By his own pen he reveals to us his state
of mind before and on that dismal February day
when he beheld Samuel Chase arraigned at the bar
of the Senate of the United States. During the
trial Marshall's bearing as a witness<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> again exhibited
his trepidation. And, as we have seen, he
had good cause for sharp anxiety.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>The avowed Republican purpose to remove him
and his Federalist associates from the Supreme Bench,
the settled and well-known intention of Jefferson to
appoint Spencer Roane as Chief Justice when Marshall
was ousted, and the certainty that this would
be fatal to the execution of those fundamental principles
of government to which Marshall was so passionately
devoted&mdash;these important considerations fully
warranted the apprehension which the Chief Justice
felt and now displayed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Had he been indifferent to the peril that confronted
him and the whole National Judiciary, he
would have exhibited a woeful lack of sense and
feeling. He was more than justified in resorting to
any honorable expedient to save the great office he
held from occupancy by a resolute and resourceful
foe of those Constitutional theories, the application
of which, Marshall firmly believed, was indispensable
to the sound development of the American Nation.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the trial were as dramatic
as the event itself was momentous.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The scenes of
the impeachment prosecution of Warren Hastings
were still vivid in the minds of all, and in imitation
of that spectacle, the Senate Chamber was now bedecked
with impressive splendor. It was aglow with
theatrical color, and the placing of the various seats
was as if a tragic play were to be performed.</p>

<p>To the right and left of the President's chair were
two rows of benches with desks, the whole covered
with crimson cloth. Here sat the thirty-four Senators
of the United States. Three rows of benches,
arranged in tiers, extended from the wall toward the
center of the room; these were covered with green
cloth and were occupied by the members of the
House of Representatives. Upon their right an enclosure
had been constructed, and in it were the
members of Jefferson's Cabinet.</p>

<p>Beneath the permanent gallery to which the
general public was admitted, a temporary gallery,
supported by pillars, ran along the wall, and faced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the crimson-covered places of the Senators. At
either end of it were boxes. Comfortable seats had
been provided in this enclosure; and these were
covered with green cloth, which also was draped over
the balustrade.</p>

<p>This sub-gallery and the boxes were filled with
ladies dressed in the height of fashion. A passageway
was left from the President's chair to the doorway.
On either side of this aisle were two stalls
covered with blue cloth, as were also the chairs
within them. They were occupied by the managers
of the House of Representatives and by the lawyers
who conducted the defense.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>A short, slender, elegantly formed man, with
pallid face and steady black eyes, presided over this
Senatorial Court. He was carefully dressed, and his
manners and deportment were meticulously correct.
Aaron Burr, fresh from his duel with Hamilton, and
under indictment in two States, had resumed his
duties as Vice-President. Nothing in the bearing of
this playwright character indicated in the smallest
degree that anything out of the ordinary had happened
to him. The circumstance of his presence,
however, dismayed even the most liberal of the
New England Federalists. "We are indeed fallen on
evil times," wrote Senator Plumer. "The high office
of President is filled by an <i>infidel</i>, that of Vice-President
by a <i>murderer</i>."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>For the first time since the Republican victory of
1800, which, but for his skill, courage, and energy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
New York, would not have been achieved,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Burr
now found himself in favor with the Administration
and the Republican chieftains.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Jefferson determined
that Aaron Burr must be captured&mdash;at least
conciliated. He could not be displaced as the presiding
officer at the Chase impeachment trial; his
rulings would be influential, perhaps decisive; the
personal friendship and admiration of several Senators
for him were well known; the emergency of
the Republican Party was acute. Chase must be
convicted at all hazards; and while nobody but
Jefferson then doubted that this would be the result,
no chances were to be taken, no precaution overlooked.</p>

<p>The President had rewarded the three principal
witnesses against Pickering with important and
lucrative offices<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> after the insane judge had been
removed from the bench. Indeed he had given the
vacated judgeship to one of these witnesses. But
such an example Jefferson well knew would have no
effect upon Burr; even promises would avail nothing
with the man who for nearly three years had suffered
indignity and opposition from an Administration
which he, more than any one man except Jefferson
himself, had placed in power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>So it came about that Vice-President Aaron Burr,
with only four weeks of official life left him, with the
whole North clamorous against him because of his
killing of Hamilton and an indictment of murder
hanging over him in New Jersey, now found himself
showered with favors by those who owed him so
much and who, for nearly four years, had so grossly
insulted him.</p>

<p>Burr's stepson, his brother-in-law, his most intimate
friend, were forthwith appointed to the three
most valuable and commanding offices in the new
government of the Louisiana Territory, at the attractive
city of New Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The members of
the Cabinet became attentive to Burr. The President
himself exercised his personal charm upon the
fallen politician. Time after time Burr was now
invited to dine with Jefferson at the Executive
Mansion.</p>

<p>Nor were Presidential dinners, the bestowal of
patronage hitherto offensively refused, and attentions
of the Cabinet, the limit of the efforts to win
the co&ouml;peration of the man who was to preside over
the trial of Samuel Chase. Senator Giles drew a
petition to the Governor of New Jersey begging that
the prosecution of Burr for murder be dropped, and
to this paper he secured the signature of nearly all
the Republican Senators.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Burr accepted these advances with grave and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
reserved dignity; but he understood the purpose
that inspired them, did not commit himself, and
remained uninfluenced and impartial. Throughout
the momentous trial the Vice-President was a model
presiding officer. "He conducted with the dignity
and impartiality of an angel, but with the rigor of
a devil," records a Washington newspaper that was
bitterly hostile to Burr personally and politically.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>When Chase took his place in the box, the
Sergeant-at-Arms brought him a chair; but Burr,
adhering to the English custom, which required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
prisoners to stand when on trial in court, ordered
it to be taken away.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Upon the request of the elderly
Justice, however, Burr quickly relented and the
desired seat was provided.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>Chase was, in appearance, the opposite of the
diminutive and graceful Vice-President. More than
six feet tall, with thick, broad, burly shoulders, he
was a picture of rugged and powerful physical manhood,
marred by an accumulation of fat which his
generous manner of living had produced. Also he
was afflicted with an agonizing gout, with which it
seems so many of "the fathers" were cursed. His face
was broad and massive, his complexion a brownish
red.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> "Bacon face" was a nickname applied to him
by the Maryland bar.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> His head was large, his brow
wide, and his hair was thick and white with the snows
of his sixty-four winters.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>The counsel that surrounded the impeached Justice
were brilliant and learned.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> They were Joseph
Hopkinson, who six years before, upon Marshall's
return from France, had written "Hail Columbia;
or, The President's March"; Philip Barton Key,
brother of the author of "The Star-Spangled Banner";<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
Robert Goodloe Harper, one of the Federalist
leaders in Congress during the ascendancy of that
party; and Charles Lee, Attorney-General under
President Adams when Marshall was Secretary of
State, and one of Marshall's most devoted friends.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>But in the chair next to Chase sat a man who,
single-handed and alone, was more than a match for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
all the managers of the House put together. Luther
Martin of Maryland&mdash;of medium height, broad-shouldered,
near-sighted, absent-minded, shabbily
attired, harsh of voice, now sixty-one years old,
with gray hair beginning to grow thin and a face
crimsoned by the brandy which he continually imbibed&mdash;was
the dominating figure of this historic
contest.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Weary and harried as he was, Randolph opened
the trial with a speech of some skill. He contrasted
the conduct of Chase in the trial of Callender with
that of Marshall in a trial in Richmond in 1804 at
which Marshall had presided. "Sir," said Randolph,
"in the famous case of Logwood,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> whereat the
Chief Justice of the United States presided, I was
present, being one of the grand jury who found a
true bill against him.... The government was as
deeply interested in arresting the career of this
dangerous and atrocious criminal, who had aimed
his blow against the property of every man in society,
as it could be in bringing to punishment a weak
and worthless scribbler [Callender]."</p>

<p>But how had Marshall acted in the conduct of that
trial? "Although," continued Randolph, "much
testimony was offered by the prisoner, which did
by no means go to his entire exculpation, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
much of that testimony was of a very questionable
nature, none of it was declared <i>inadmissable</i>."
Marshall suffered it "to go to the jury, who were
left to judge of its weight and credibility"; nor had
he required "any interrogatories to the witnesses ...
to be reduced to writing,"&mdash;such a thing never had
been done in Virginia before the tyrannical ruling of
Chase in the trial of Callender.</p>

<p>"No, Sir!" he cried. "The enlightened man who
presided in Logwood's case knew that, although the
basest and vilest of criminals, he was entitled to
<i>justice</i>, equally with the most honorable member of
society." Marshall "did not avail himself of the
previous and great discoveries in criminal law, of
this respondent [Chase]"; Marshall "admitted the
prisoner's testimony to go to the jury"; Marshall
"never thought it <i>his right</i> or <i>his duty</i> to require
questions to be reduced to writing"; Marshall "gave
the accused <i>a fair trial</i> according to law and usage,
without any innovation or departure from the
established rules of criminal jurisprudence in his
country."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 572px;">

<span class="caption">JOHN RANDOLPH</span>
</div>

<p>Marshall's gentle manner and large-minded, soft-spoken
rulings as a trial judge were thus adroitly
made to serve as an argument for the condemnation
of his associate, and for his own undoing if Chase
should be convicted. Randolph denounced "the
monstrous pretension that an act to be impeachable
must be indictable. Where? In the Federal Courts?
There, not even robbery and murder are indictable."</p>

<p>A judge could not, under the National law, be indicted
for conducting a National court while drunk,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and perhaps not in all State courts. "It is indictable
nowhere for him to omit to do his duty, to refuse
to hold a court. But who can doubt that both are
impeachable offenses, and ought to subject the
offender to removal from office?"</p>

<p>The autocrat of Congress then boldly announced
to the Republican Senators that the House managers
"confidently expect on his [Chase's] conviction....
We shall bring forward ... such a specimen
of judicial tyranny, as, I trust in God, will never be
again exhibited in our country."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Fifty-two witnesses were examined. It was established
that, in the trial of Fries, Chase had written
the opinion of the court upon the law before the jury
was sworn, solely in order to save time; had withdrawn
the paper and destroyed it when he found
Fries's counsel resented the court's precipitate action;
and, finally, had repeatedly urged them to
proceed with the defense without restriction. Chase's
inquisitorial conduct in Delaware was proved, and
several witnesses testified to the matter and manner
of his charge to the Baltimore grand jury.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Every incident in the trial of Callender<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> was
described by numerous witnesses.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> George Hay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
who had been the most aggressive of Callender's
counsel, was so anxious to help the managers that
he made a bad impression on the Senate by his
eagerness.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> It developed that the whole attitude of
Chase had been one of sarcastic contempt; and that
Callender's counsel were more piqued by the laughter
of the spectators which the witty sallies and humorous
manner of the Justice excited, than they were
outraged by any violence on Chase's part, or even
by what they considered the illegal and oppressive
nature of his rulings.</p>

<p>When, in defending Callender, Hay had insisted
upon "a literal recital of the parts [of <i>The Prospect
Before Us</i>] charged as libellous," Chase, looking
around the court-room, said with an ironical smile:
"It is contended ... that the book ought to be copied
<i>verbatim et literatim</i>, I wonder, ... that <i>they</i> do not
contend for <i>punctuatim</i> too."<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The audience laughed.
Chase's interruption of Wirt<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> by calling the young
lawyer's "syllogistical" conclusion a "<i>non sequitur</i>,
sir," was accompanied by an inimitable "bow" that
greatly amused the listeners.</p>

<p>In short, the interruptions of the sardonic old Justice
were, as John Taylor of Caroline testified, in "a
very high degree imperative, satirical, and witty
... [and] extremely well calculated to abash and disconcert
counsel."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the witnesses was Marshall's brother
William, whom President Adams had appointed
clerk of the United States Court at Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
His testimony was important on one point. One
John Heath, a Richmond attorney and a perfect
stranger to Chase, had sworn that Chase, in his
presence, had asked the United States Marshal,
David M. Randolph, "if he had any of those creatures
or people called democrats on the panel of
the jury to try Callender"; that when the Marshal
replied that he had "made no discrimination," the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Judge told him "to look over the panel and if there
were any of that description, strike them off."</p>

<p>William Marshall, on the contrary, made oath
that Chase told him that he hoped even Giles would
serve on the jury&mdash;"Nay, he wished that Callender
might be tried by a jury of his own politics."
David M. Randolph then testified that he had never
seen Heath in the Judge's chambers, that Chase
"never at any time or place" said anything to him
about striking any names from the jury panel, and
that he never received "any instructions, verbal,
or by letter, from Judge Chase in relation to the
grand jury."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>John Marshall himself was then called to the
stand and sworn. Friendly eye-witnesses record that
the Chief Justice appeared to be frightened. He
testified that Colonel Harvie, with whom he "was
intimately acquainted,"<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> had asked him to get the
Marshal to excuse Harvie from serving on the jury
because "his mind was completely made up ... and
whatever the evidence might be, he should find the
traverser not guilty." When Marshall told this to
the court official, the latter said that Harvie must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
apply to the Judge, because he "was watched," and
"to prevent any charge of improper conduct" he
would not discharge any of the jury whom he had
summoned. Marshall then induced Chase to release
Harvie "upon the ground of his being sheriff of
Henrico County and that his attendance was necessary"
at the county court then in session.</p>

<p>Marshall said that he was in court during a part
of the Callender trial and that "there were several
circumstances that took place ... on the part both
of the bar and the bench which do not always occur
at trials.... The counsel appeared ... to wish to
argue to the jury that the Sedition Law was unconstitutional.
Mr. Chase said that that was not a
proper question to go to the jury"; and that whenever
Callender's attorneys began to argue to the
contrary the court stopped them.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice further testified that George
Hay had addressed the court to the effect that in
this ruling Chase was "not correct in point of law,"
and again the Judge "stopped him"; that "Mr. Hay
still went on and made some political observations;
Judge Chase stopped him again and the collision
ended by Mr. Hay sitting down and folding up his
papers as if he meant to retire."</p>

<p>Marshall did not recollect "precisely," although
it appeared to him that "whenever Judge Chase
thought the counsel incorrect in their points, he
immediately told them so and stopped them short."
This "began early in the proceedings and increased.
On the part of the judge it seemed to be a disgust
with regard to the mode adopted by the traverser's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
counsel, at least ... as to the part which Mr. Hay
took in the trial."</p>

<p>Randolph asked Marshall whether it was the practice
for courts to hear counsel argue against the
correctness of rulings; and Marshall replied that "if
counsel have not been already heard, it is usual to
hear them in order that they may change or confirm
the opinion of the court, when there is any doubt
entertained." But there was "no positive rule on
the subject and the course pursued by the court will
depend upon circumstances: Where the judge believes
that the point is perfectly clear and settled
he will scarcely permit the question to be agitated.
However, it is considered as decorous on the part
of the judge to listen while the counsel abstain from
urging unimportant arguments."</p>

<p>Marshall was questioned closely as to points of
practice. His answers were not favorable to his
Associate Justice. Did it appear to him that "the
conduct of Judge Chase was mild and conciliatory"
during the trial of Callender? Marshall replied that
he ought to be asked what Chase's conduct was and
not what he thought of it. Senator William Cocke
of Tennessee said the question was improper, and
Randolph offered to withdraw it. "No!" exclaimed
Chase's counsel, "we are willing to abide in this trial
by the opinion of the Chief Justice." Marshall declared
that, except in the Callender trial, he never
heard a court refuse to admit the testimony of a witness
because it went only to a part and not to the
whole of a charge.</p>

<p>Burr asked Marshall: "Do you recollect whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the conduct of the judge at this trial was tyrannical,
overbearing and oppressive?" "I will state the
facts," cautiously answered the Chief Justice.
"Callender's counsel persisted in arguing the question
of the constitutionality of the Sedition Law,
in which they were constantly repressed by Judge
Chase. Judge Chase checked Mr. Hay whenever
he came to that point, and after having resisted
repeated checks, Mr. Hay appeared to be determined
to abandon the cause, when he was desired
by the judge to proceed with his argument and informed
that he should not be interrupted thereafter.</p>

<p>"If," continued Marshall, "this is not considered
tyrannical, oppressive and overbearing, I know
nothing else that was so." It was usual for courts
to hear counsel upon the validity of rulings "not
solemnly pronounced," and "by no means usual in
Virginia to try a man for an offense at the same term
at which he is presented"; although, said Marshall,
"my practice, while I was at the bar was very limited
in criminal cases."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear Judge Chase apply any unusual
epithets&mdash;such as '<i>young men</i>' or '<i>young
gentlemen</i>'&mdash;to counsel?" inquired Randolph. "I
have heard it so frequently spoken of since the
trial that I cannot possibly tell whether my recollection
of the term is derived from expressions used
in court, or from the frequent mention since made
of them." But, remarked Marshall, having thus
adroitly placed the burden on the irresponsible
shoulders of gossip, "I am rather inclined to think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that I did hear them from the judge." Randolph
then drew from Marshall the startling and important
fact that William Wirt was "about thirty years
of age and a widower."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Senator Plumer, with evident reluctance, sets
down in his diary a description from which it would
appear that Marshall's manner affected the Senate
most unfavorably. "John Marshall is the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
I was much better pleased with the manner in which
his brother testified than with him.</p>

<p>"The Chief Justice really discovered too much
caution&mdash;too much fear&mdash;too much cunning&mdash;He
ought to have been more bold&mdash;frank &amp; explicit
than he was.</p>

<p>"There was in his manner an evident disposition
to accommodate the Managers. That dignified
frankness which his high office required did not appear.
A cunning man ought never to discover the
arts of the <i>trimmer</i> in his testimony."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Plainly Marshall was still fearful of the outcome
of the Republican impeachment plans, not only as
to Chase, but as to the entire Federalist membership
of the Supreme Court. His understanding of
the Republican purpose, his letter to Chase, and his
manner on the stand at the trial leave no doubt as
to his state of mind. A Republican Supreme Court,
with Spencer Roane as Chief Justice, loomed forbiddingly
before him.</p>

<p>Chase was suffering such agony from the gout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that, when the testimony was all in, he asked to
be released from further attendance.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Six days before
the evidence was closed, the election returns
were read and counted, and Aaron Burr "declared
Thomas Jefferson and George Clinton to be duly
elected to the respective offices of President and
Vice-President of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> For the
first time in our history this was done publicly; on
former occasions the galleries were cleared and the
doors closed.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the trial Randolph and Giles were in
frequent conference&mdash;judge and prosecutor working
together for the success of the party plan.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> On
February 20 the arguments began. Peter Early of
Georgia spoke first. His remarks were "chiefly
declamatory."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> He said that the conduct of Chase
exhibited that species of oppression which puts
accused citizens "at the mercy of <i>arbitrary and
overbearing judges</i>." For an hour and a half he
reviewed the charges,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> but he spoke so badly that
"most of the members of the other House left the
chamber &amp; a large portion of the spectators the
gallery."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>George Washington Campbell of Tennessee argued
"long and tedious[ly]"<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> for the Jeffersonian
idea of impeachment which he held to be "a kind
of an inquest into the conduct of an officer ... and the
effects that his conduct ... may have on society."
He analyzed the official deeds of Chase by which
"the whole community seemed shocked.... Future
generations are interested in the event."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> He spoke
for parts of two days, having to suspend midway in
the argument because of exhaustion.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Like Early,
Campbell emptied the galleries and drove the members
of the House, in disgust, from the floor.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Joseph Hopkinson then opened for the defense.
Although but thirty-four years old, his argument
was not surpassed,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> even by that of Martin&mdash;in
fact, it was far more orderly and logical than that
of Maryland's great attorney-general. "We appear,"
began Hopkinson, "for an ancient and infirm man,
whose better days have been worn out in the service
of that country which now degrades him." The
case was "of infinite importance," truly declared
the youthful attorney. "The faithful, the scrutinizing
historian, ... without fear or favor" will render
the final judgment. The House managers were following
the British precedent in the impeachment of
Warren Hastings; but that celebrated prosecution
had not been instituted, as had that of Chase, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
"a petty catalogue of frivolous occurrences, more
calculated to excite ridicule than apprehension, but
for the alleged murder of princes and plunder of
empires"; yet Hastings had been acquitted.</p>

<p>In England only two judges had been impeached
in half a century, while in the United States "seven
judges have been prosecuted criminally in about
two years." Could a National judge be impeached
merely for "error, mistake, or indiscretion"? Absurd!
Such action could be taken only for "an indictable
offense." Thus Hopkinson stated the master
question of the case. In a clear, closely woven argument,
the youthful advocate maintained his ground.</p>

<p>The power of impeachment by the House was
not left entirely to the "opinion, whim, or caprice"
of its members, but was limited by other provisions
of the fundamental law. Chase was not charged
with treason, bribery, or corruption. Had any other
"high crimes and misdemeanors" been proved or
even stated against him? He could not be impeached
for ordinary offenses, but only for "high
crimes and high misdemeanors." Those were legal
and technical terms, "well understood and defined
in law.... A misdemeanor or a crime ... is an act
committed or omitted, in violation of a <i>public</i> law
either forbidding or commanding it. By this test, let
the respondent ... stand justified or condemned."</p>

<p>The very nature of the Senatorial Court indicated
"the grade of offenses intended for its jurisdiction....
Was such a court created ... to scan and punish
paltry errors and indiscretions, too insignificant to
have a name in the penal code, too paltry for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
notice of a court of quarter sessions? This is indeed
employing an elephant to remove an atom too
minute for the grasp of an insect."</p>

<p>Had Chase transgressed any State or National
statute? Had he violated the common law? Nobody
claimed that he had. Could any judge be
firm, unbiased, and independent if he might at any
time be impeached "on the mere suggestions of
caprice ... condemned by the mere voice of prejudice"?
No!  "If his nerves are of iron, they must
tremble in so perilous a situation."</p>

<p>Hopkinson dwelt upon the true function of the
Judiciary under free institutions. "All governments
require, in order to give them firmness, stability, and
character, some permanent principle, some settled
establishment. The want of this is the great deficiency
in republican institutions." In the American
Government an independent, permanent Judiciary
supplied this vital need. Without it "nothing can
be relied on; no faith can be given either at home or
abroad." It was also "a security from oppression."</p>

<p>All history proved that republics could be as
tyrannical as despotisms; not systematically, it was
true, but as the result of "sudden gust of passion
or prejudice.... If we have read of the death of a
Seneca under the ferocity of a Nero, we have read
too of the murder of a Socrates under the delusion
of a Republic. An independent and firm Judiciary,
protected and protecting by the laws, would have
snatched the one from the fury of a despot, and preserved
the other from the madness of a people."<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
spoke Joseph Hopkinson for three hours,<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> made brief
and brilliant by his eloquence, logic, and learning.</p>

<p>Philip Barton Key of Washington, younger even
than Hopkinson, next addressed the Senatorial
Court. He had been ill the day before<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> and was
still indisposed, but made an able speech. He analyzed,
with painstaking minuteness, the complaints
against his client, and cleverly turned to Chase's
advantage the conduct of Marshall in the Logwood
case.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Charles Lee then spoke for the defense; but
what he said was so technical, applying merely to
Virginia legal practice of the time, that it is of no
historical moment.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>When, on the next day, February 23, Luther
Martin rose, the Senate Chamber could not contain
even a small part of the throng that sought the
Capitol to hear the celebrated lawyer. If he "<i>only</i>
appeared in defense of a friend," said Martin, he
would not be so gravely concerned; but the case was
plainly of highest possible importance, not only to
all Americans then living, but to "posterity." It
would "establish a most important precedent as to
future cases of impeachment." An error now would
be fatal.</p>

<p>For what did the Constitution authorize the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
House to impeach and the Senate to try an officer
of the National Government? asked Martin. Only
for "an indictable offense." Treason and bribery,
specifically named in the Constitution as impeachable
offenses, were also indictable. It was the same
with "other high crimes and misdemeanors," the
only additional acts for which impeachment was
provided. To be sure, a judge might do deeds for
which he could be indicted that would not justify
his impeachment, as, for instance, physical assault
"provoked by insolence." But let the House managers
name one act for which a judge could be impeached
that did not also subject him to indictment.</p>

<p>Congress could pass a law making an act criminal
which had not been so before; but such a law applied
only to deeds committed after, and not to those
done before, its passage. Yet if an officer might,
years after the event, be impeached, convicted, and
punished for conduct perfectly legal at the time,
"could the officers of Government ever know how to
proceed?" Establish such a principle and "you
leave your judges, and all your other officers, at the
mercy of the prevailing party."</p>

<p>Had Chase "used <i>unusual</i>, rude and <i>contemptuous</i>
expressions towards the prisoner's counsel" in the
Callender case, as the articles of impeachment
charged? Even so, this was "rather a violation of
the principles of politeness, than the principles of
law; rather the want of decorum, than the commission
of a <i>high crime and misdemeanor</i>." Was a judge
to be impeached and removed from office because
his deportment was not elegant?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth was that Callender's counsel had not
acted in his interest and had cared nothing about
him; they had wished only "to hold up the prosecution
as oppressive" in order to "excite public indignation
against the court and the Government."
Had not Hay just testified that he entertained "no
hopes of convincing the court, and scarcely the
faintest expectation of inducing the jury to believe
that the sedition law was unconstitutional"; but
that he had wished to make an "impression upon
the public mind.... What barefaced, what unequalled
hypocrisy doth he admit that he practiced
on that occasion! What egregious trifling with the
court!" exclaimed Martin.</p>

<p>When Chase had observed that Wirt's syllogism
was a "<i>non sequitur</i>," the Judge, it seems, had
"bowed." Monstrous! But "as <i>bows</i>, sir, according
to the manner they are <i>made</i>, may ... convey very
different meanings," why had not the witness who
told of it, "given us a <i>fac simile</i> of it?" The Senate
then could have judged of "the propriety" of the
bow. "But it seems this <i>bow</i>, together with the
'<i>non sequitur</i>' entirely discomfitted poor Mr. Wirt,
and down he sat 'and never word spake more!'"
By all means let Chase be convicted and removed
from the bench&mdash;it would never do to permit National
judges to make bows in any such manner!</p>

<p>But alas for Chase! He had committed another
grave offense&mdash;he had called William Wirt "<i>young</i>
gentleman" in spite of the fact that Wirt was actually
thirty years old and a widower. Perhaps Chase
did not know "of these circumstances"; still, "if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
he had, considering that Mr. Wirt was a widower,
he certainly erred on the right side ... in calling <i>him</i>
a <i>young</i> gentleman."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>When the laughter of the Senate had subsided,
Martin, dropping his sarcasm, once more emphasized
the vital necessity of the independence of the
Judiciary. "We boast" that ours is a "government
of laws. But how can it be such, unless the laws,
while they exist, are sacredly and impartially, without
regard to popularity, carried into execution?"
Only independent judges can do this. "Our property,
our liberty, our lives, can only be protected
and secured by such judges. With this honorable
Court it remains, whether we shall have such
judges!"<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>Martin spoke until five o'clock without food or
any sustenance, "except two glasses of wine and
water"; he said he had not even breakfasted that
morning, and asked permission to finish his argument
next day.</p>

<p>When he resumed, he dwelt on the liberty of the
press which Chase's application of the Sedition Law
to Callender's libel was said to have violated. "My
honorable client with many other respectable characters
... considered it [that law] as a wholesome and
necessary restraint" upon the licentiousness of the
press.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Martin then quoted with telling effect from
Franklin's denunciation of newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> "Franklin,
himself a printer," had been "as great an advocate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
for the liberty of the press, as any reasonable man
ought to be"; yet he had "declared that unless the
slander and calumny of the press is restrained by
some other law, it will be restrained by club law."
Was not that true?</p>

<p>If men cannot be protected by the courts against
"base calumniators, they will become their own
avengers. And to the bludgeon, the sword or the
pistol, they will resort for that purpose." Yet Chase
stood impeached for having, as a judge, enforced
the law against the author of "one of the most
flagitious libels ever published in America."<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>Throughout his address Martin mingled humor
with logic, eloquence with learning.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Granted, he
said, that Chase had used the word "damned" in his
desultory conversation with Triplett during their
journey in a stage. "However it may sound elsewhere
in the United States, I cannot apprehend it
will be considered <i>very</i> offensive, <i>even</i> from the
mouth of a judge on this side of the Susquehanna;&mdash;to
the southward of that river it is in familiar use ...
supplying frequently the place of the word 'very'
... connected with subjects the most pleasing; thus
we say indiscriminately a very good or a damned
good bottle of wine, a damned good dinner, or a
damned clever fellow."<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>Martin's great speech deeply impressed the
Senate with the ideas that Chase was a wronged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
man, that the integrity of the whole National Judicial
establishment was in peril, and that impeachment
was being used as a partisan method of placing
the National Bench under the rod of a political
party. And all this was true.</p>

<p>Robert Goodloe Harper closed for the defense.
He was intolerably verbose, but made a good argument,
well supported by precedents. In citing the
example which Randolph had given as a good cause
for impeachment&mdash;the refusal of a judge to hold
court&mdash;Harper came near, however, making a
fatal admission. This, said Harper, would justify
impeachment, although perhaps not an indictment.
Most of his speech was a repetition of points already
made by Hopkinson, Key, and Martin. But Harper's
remarks on Chase's charge to the Baltimore
grand jury were new, that article having been left
to him.</p>

<p>"Is it not lawful," he asked, "for an aged patriot
of the Revolution to warn his fellow-citizens
of dangers, by which he supposes their liberties
and happiness to be threatened?" That was all
that Chase's speech from the bench in Baltimore
amounted to. Did his office take from a judge "the
liberty of speech which belongs to every citizen"?
Judges often made political speeches on the stump&mdash;"What
law forbids [them] to exercise these
rights by a charge from the bench?" That practice
had "been sanctioned by the custom of this country
from the beginning of the Revolution to this
day."</p>

<p>Harper cited many instances of the delivery by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
judges of political charges to grand juries, beginning
with the famous appeal to the people to fight for
independence from British rule, made in a charge to
a South Carolina grand jury in 1776.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>The blows of Chase's strong counsel, falling in
unbroken succession, had shaken the nerve of the
House managers. One of these, Joseph H. Nicholson
of Maryland, now replied. Posterity would indeed
be the final judge of Samuel Chase. Warren
Hastings had been acquitted; "but is there any who
hears me, that believes he was innocent?" The
judgment of the Senate involved infinitely more
than the fortunes of Chase; by it "must ultimately
be determined whether justice shall hereafter be
impartially administered or whether the rights of
the citizen are to be prostrated at the feet of overbearing
and tyrannical judges."</p>

<p>Nicholson denied that the House managers had
"resorted to the forlorn hope of contending that an
impeachment was not a criminal prosecution, but
a mere inquest of office.... If declarations of this
kind have been made, in the name of the Managers,
I here disclaim them. We do contend that this is a
criminal prosecution, for offenses committed in the
discharge of high official duties."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>The Senate was dumbfounded, the friends of Chase
startled with joyful surprise; a gasp of amazement
ran through the overcrowded Chamber! Nicholson
had abandoned the Republican position&mdash;and at a
moment when Harper had all but admitted it to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
sound. What could this mean but that the mighty
onslaughts of Martin and Hopkinson had disconcerted
the managers, or that Republican Senators
were showing to the leaders signs of weakening in
support of the party doctrine.</p>

<p>At any rate, Nicholson's admission was an irretrievable
blunder. He should have stoutly championed
his party's theory upon which Chase had
been impeached and thus far tried, ignored the
subject entirely, or remained silent. Sadly confused,
he finally reversed his argument and swung
back to the original Republican theory.</p>

<p>He cited many hypothetical cases where an officer
could not be haled before a criminal court, but could
be impeached. One of these must have furnished
cause for secret mirth to many a Senator: "It is possible,"
said Nicholson, "that the day may arrive
when a President of the United States ... may endeavor
to influence [Congress] by holding out threats
or inducements to them.... The hope of an office
may be held out to a Senator; and I think it cannot
be doubted, that for this the President would be
liable to impeachment, although there is no positive
law forbidding it."</p>

<p>Lucky for Nicholson that Martin had spoken before
him and could not reply; fortunate for Jefferson
that the "impudent Federal Bulldog,"<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> as the
President afterward styled Martin, could not now be
heard. For his words would have burned the paper
on which the reporters transcribed them. Every
Senator knew how patronage and all forms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Executive inducement and coercion had been used
by the Administration in the passage of most important
measures&mdash;the Judiciary repeal, the Pickering
impeachment, the Yazoo compromise, the
trial of Chase. From the floor of the House John
Randolph had just denounced, with blazing wrath,
Jefferson's Postmaster-General for offering Government
contracts to secure votes for the Yazoo compromise.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>For two hours and a half Nicholson continued,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
devoting himself mainly to the conduct of Chase
during the trial of Fries. He closed by pointing out
the inducements to a National judge to act as a
tyrannical tool of a partisan administration&mdash;the
offices with which he could be bribed, the promotions
by which he could be rewarded. The influence
of the British Ministry over the judges has been "too
flagrant to be mistaken." For example, in Ireland
"an overruling influence has crumbled [an independent
judiciary] into ruins. The demon of destruction
has entered their courts of justice, and spread desolation
over the land. Execution has followed execution,
until the oppressed, degraded and insulted nation
has been made to tremble through every nerve, and
to bleed at every pore."</p>

<p>The fate of Ireland would be that of America, if
an uncontrolled Judiciary were allowed to carry out,
without fear of impeachment, the will of a high-handed
President, in order to win the preferments
he had to offer. Already "some of our judges have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>been elevated to places of high political importance....
Let us nip the evil in the bud, or it may
grow to an enormous tree, bearing destruction upon
every branch."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>C&aelig;sar A. Rodney of Delaware strove to repair
the havoc Nicholson had wrought; he made it worse.
The trial was, he said, "a spectacle truly solemn and
impressive ... a trial of the first importance, because
of the first impression; ... a trial ... whose novelty
and magnitude have excited so much interest ... that
it seems to have superseded for the moment, not only
every other grave object or pursuit, but every other
fashionable amusement or dissipation."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>Rodney flattered Burr, whose conduct of the
trial had been "an example worthy of imitation."
He cajoled the Senators, whose attitude he had "observed
with heartfelt pleasure and honest pride";
and he warned them not to take as a precedent
the case of Warren Hastings, "that destroyer of the
people of Asia, that devastator of the East,"&mdash;murderer
of men, violator of <i>zenanas</i>, destroyer of
sacred treaties, but yet acquitted by the British
House of Lords.</p>

<p>Counsel for Chase had spoken with "the fascinating
voice of eloquence and the deluding tongue of
ingenuity"; but Rodney would avoid "everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
like declamation" and speak "in the temperate language
of reason."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> He was sure that "the weeping
voice of history will be heard to deplore the oppressive
acts and criminal excesses [of Samuel Chase]....
In the dark catalogue of criminal enormities, perhaps
few are to be found of deeper dye" than those named
in the articles of impeachment. "The independence
of the Judiciary, the political tocsin of the day, and
<i>the alarm bell of the night</i>, has been rung through
every change in our ears.... The poor hobby has
been literally rode to death." Rodney was for
a "rational independence of the Judiciary," but
not for the "inviolability of judges more than of
Kings.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> In this country I am afraid the doctrine
has been carried to such an extravagant length,
that the Judiciary may be considered like a spoiled
child."</p>

<p>An independent Judiciary, indeed! "We all know
that an associate justice may sigh for promotion,
and may be created a Chief Justice,<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> while ... more
than one Chief Justice has been appointed a Minister
Plenipotentiary."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> With what result? Had
judges stood aloof from politics&mdash;or had they
"united in the <i>Io triumphe</i> which the votaries and
idolators of power have sung to those who were
seated in the car of Government? Have they made
no offerings at the shrine of party; have they not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
preached political sermons from the bench, in which
they have joined chorus with the anonymous scribblers
of the day and the infuriate instruments of
faction?"<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>In this fashion Rodney began a song of praise of
Jefferson, for the beneficence of whose Administration
"the lamentable annals of mankind afford no
example." After passing through many "citadels"
and "Scean gates," and other forms of rhetorical
architecture, he finally discovered Chase "seated
in a curricle of passion" which the Justice had
"driven on, Ph&aelig;ton-like, ... with destruction, persecution,
and oppression" following.</p>

<p>At last the orator attempted to discuss the law of
the impeachment, taking the double ground that
an officer could be removed for any act that two
thirds of the Senate believed to be not "good behavior,"
and that the Chase impeachment was "a
criminal prosecution." For parts of two days<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
Rodney examined every phase of the charges in a
distracting mixture of high-flown language, scattered
learning, extravagant metaphor, and jumbled
logic.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> His speech was a wretched performance, so
cluttered with tawdry rhetoric and disjointed argument
that it would have been poor even as a stump
speech.</p>

<p>In an address that enraged the New England
Federalists, Randolph closed for the House managers.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
He was late in arriving at the Senate Cham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>ber.
He had been so ill the day before that Nicholson,
because of Randolph's "habitual indisposition,"
had asked the Senate to meet two hours later
than the usual time.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Sick as he was, without his
notes (which he had lost), Randolph nevertheless
made the best argument for the prosecution. Wasting
no time, he took up the theory of impeachment
upon which, he said, "the wildest opinions have
been advanced"&mdash;for instance, "that an offense,
to be impeachable, must be indictable." Why,
then, had the article on impeachment been placed
in the Constitution at all? Why "not have said,
at once, that any ... officer ... convicted on indictment
should (<i>ipso facto</i>) be removed from office?
This would be coming at the thing by a short and
obvious way."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>Suppose a President should veto every act of
Congress "indiscriminately"; it was his Constitutional
right to do so; he could not be indicted, but
would anybody say he could not be impeached? Or
if, at a short session, the President should keep back
until the last moment all bills passed within the previous
ten days, as the Constitution authorized him
to do, so that it would be a physical impossibility
for the two Houses to pass the rejected measures
over the President's veto, he could not be indicted
for this abuse of power; but surely "he could be
impeached, removed and disqualified."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Randolph's Virginia soul was deeply stirred by
what he considered Chase's alternate effrontery
and cowardice. Is such a character "fit to preside
in a court of justice?... Today, haughty, violent,
imperious; tomorrow, humble, penitent and submissive....
Is this a character to dispense law and
justice to this nation? No, Sir!" Randolph then
drew an admirable picture of the ideal judge: "firm,
indeed, but temperate, mild though unyielding,
neither a blustering bravo, nor a timid poltroon."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>As far as he could go without naming him, Randolph
described John Marshall. Not without result
had the politically experienced Chief Justice conciliated
the House managers in the manner that had so
exasperated the Federalist Senators. He would not
thereafter be impeached if John Randolph could
prevent.</p>

<p>With keen pleasure at the annoyance he knew
his words would give to Jefferson,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Randolph continued
to praise Marshall. The rejection of Colonel
Taylor's testimony at the Callender trial was contrary
to "the universal practice of our courts."
On this point "what said the Chief Justice of the
United States," on whose evidence Randolph said
he specially relied? "He never knew such a case [to]
occur before. He never heard a similar objection
advanced by any court, until that instance. And
this is the cautious and guarded language of a man
placed in the delicate situation of being compelled
to give testimony against a brother judge."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>With an air of triumph Randolph asked: "Can
anyone doubt Mr. Marshall's thorough acquaintance
with our laws? Can it be pretended that any man
is better versed in their theory and practice? And
yet in all his extensive reading, his long and extensive
practice, in the many trials of which he has been
spectator, and the yet greater number at which he
has assisted, he had never witnessed such a case."
Chase alone had discovered "this fatal novelty, this
new and horrible doctrine that threatens at one
blow all that is valuable in our criminal jurisprudence."</p>

<p>Had Martin shown that Chase was right in requiring
questions to be reduced to writing? "Here
again," declared Randolph, "I bottom myself upon
the testimony of the same great man, yet more illustrious
for his abilities than for the high station that
he fills, eminent as it is." And he recited the substance
of Marshall's testimony on this point. Consider
his description of the bearing of Chase toward
counsel! "I again ask you, what said the Chief
Justice?... And what did he <i>look</i>?<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> He felt all the
delicacy of his situation, and, as he could not approve,
he declined giving any opinion on the demeanor
of his associate."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> In such manner Randolph
extolled Marshall.</p>

<p>Again he apostrophized the Chief Justice. If Fries
and Callender "had had fair trials, our lips would
have been closed in eternal silence. Look at the case
of Logwood: The able and excellent judge whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
worth was never fully known until he was raised to
the bench ... uttered not one syllable that could
prejudice the defense of the prisoner." Once more
he contrasted the judicial manners and rulings of
Marshall with those of Chase: "The Chief Justice
knew that, sooner or later, the law was an over-match
for the dishonest, and ... he disdained to
descend from his great elevation to the low level of
a public prosecutor."</p>

<p>The sick man spoke for two hours and a half, his
face often distorted and his body writhing with pain.
Finally his tense nerves gave way. Only public duty
had kept him to his task, he said. "In a little time
and I will dismiss you to the suggestions of your
own consciences. My weakness and want of ability
prevent me from urging my cause as I could wish,
but"&mdash;here the overwrought and exhausted man
broke into tears&mdash;"it is the last day of my sufferings
and of yours."</p>

<p>Mastering his indisposition, however, Randolph
closed in a passage of genuine power: "We adjure
you, on behalf of the House of Representatives and
of all the people of the United States, to exorcise
from our Courts the baleful spirit of party, to give
an awful memento to our judges. In the name of the
nation, I demand at your hands the award of justice
and of law."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>So ended this unequal forensic contest in one of
the most fateful trials in American history. The
whole country eagerly awaited tidings of the judgment
to be rendered by the Senatorial tribunal. The
fate of the Supreme Court, the character of the
National Judiciary, the career of John Marshall,
depended upon it. Even union or disunion was
involved; for if Chase should be convicted, another
and perhaps final impulse would be given to the
secessionist movement in New England, which had
been growing since the Republican attack on the
National Judiciary in 1802.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>When the Senate convened at half-past twelve on
March 1, 1805, a dense mass of auditors filled every
inch of space in the Senate Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Down the
narrow passageway men were seen bearing a couch
on which lay Senator Uriah Tracy of Connecticut,
pale and sunken from sickness. Feebly he rose and
took one of the red-covered seats of the Senatorial
judges.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>"The Sergeants-at-Arms will face the spectators
and seize and commit to prison the first person who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
makes the smallest noise or disturbance," sternly
ordered Aaron Burr.</p>

<p>"The secretary will read the first article of impeachment,"
he directed.</p>

<p>"Senator Adams of Massachusetts! How say
you? Is Samuel Chase, the respondent, guilty of
high crimes and misdemeanors as charged in the
article just read?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" responded John Quincy Adams.</p>

<p>When the name of Stephen R. Bradley, Republican
Senator from Vermont, was reached, he rose in
his place and voted against conviction. The auditors
were breathless, the Chamber filled with the
atmosphere of suspense. It was the first open break
in the Republican ranks. Two more such votes and
the carefully planned battle would be lost to Jefferson
and his party.</p>

<p>"Not guilty!" answered John Gaillard, Republican
Senator from South Carolina.</p>

<p>Another Republican defection and all would be
over. It came from the very next Senator whose
name Aaron Burr pronounced, and from one whose
answer will forever remain an enigma.</p>

<p>"Senator Giles of Virginia! How say you? Is
Samuel Chase guilty of the high crimes and misdemeanors
as charged in the articles just read?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty!"</p>

<p>Only sixteen Senators voted to impeach on the
first article, nine Republicans aligning themselves
with the nine Federalists.</p>

<p>The vote on the other articles showed varying
results; on the fourth, fourteen Senators responded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
"Guilty!"; on the fifth, the Senate was unanimous
for Chase.</p>

<p>Upon the eighth article&mdash;Chase's political charge
to the Baltimore grand jury&mdash;the desperate Republicans
tried to recover, Giles now leading them.
Indeed, it may be for this that he cast his first vote
with his party brethren from the North&mdash;he may
have thought thus to influence them on the one
really strong charge against the accused Justice.
If so, his stratagem was futile. The five Northern
Republicans (Bradley and Smith of Vermont,
Mitchell and Smith of New York, and John Smith
of Ohio) stood firm for acquittal as did the obstinate
John Gaillard of South Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>The punctilious Burr ordered the names of Senators
and their recorded answers to be read for
verification.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> He then announced the result: "It
appears that there is not a constitutional majority
of votes finding Samuel Chase, Esq. guilty of any
one article. It therefore becomes my duty to declare
that Samuel Chase, Esq. stands acquitted of all the
articles exhibited by the House of Representatives
against him."<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>The fight was over. There were thirty-four Senators,
nine of them Federalists, twenty-five Republi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>cans.
Twenty-two votes were necessary to convict.
At their strongest the Republicans had been able to
muster less than four fifths of their entire strength.
Six of their number&mdash;the New York and Vermont
Senators, together with John Gaillard of South Carolina
and John Smith of Ohio&mdash;had answered "not
guilty" on every article.</p>

<p>For the first time since his appointment, John
Marshall was secure as the head of the Supreme
Bench.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> For the first time since Jefferson's election,
the National Judiciary was, for a period, rendered
independent. For the first time in five years, the
Federalist members of the Nation's highest tribunal
could go about their duties without fear that upon
them would fall the avenging blade of impeachment
which had for half a decade hung over them. One
of the few really great crises in American history
had passed.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>"The greatest and most important trial ever held
in this nation has terminated justly," wrote Senator
Plumer to his son. "The venerable judge whose
head bears the frost of seventy winters,<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> is honorably
acquitted. I never witnessed, in any place, such
a display of learning as the counsel for the accused
exhibited."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Chagrin, anger, humiliation, raged in Randolph's
heart. His long legs could not stride as fast as his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
frenzy, when, rushing from the scene of defeat, he
flew to the floor of the House. There he offered an
amendment to the Constitution providing that the
President might remove National judges on the
joint address of both Houses of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> "Tempest
in the House," records Cutler.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>Nicholson was almost as frantic with wrath, and
quickly followed with a proposal so to amend the
Constitution that State Legislatures might, at will,
recall Senators.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>Republicans now began to complain to their party
foes of one another. Over a "rubber of whist" with
John Quincy Adams, Senator Jackson of Georgia,
even before the trial, had spoken "slightingly both
of Mr. John Randolph and of Mr. Nicholson";<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> and
this criticism of Republicans <i>inter se</i> now increased.</p>

<p>Jefferson's feelings were balanced between grief
and glee; his mourning over the untoward result of
his cherished programme of judicial reform was
ameliorated by his pleasure at the overthrow of the
unruly Randolph,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> who had presumed to dissent from
the President's Georgia land policy.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The great
politician's cup of disappointment, which the acquittal
of Chase had filled, was also sweetened by
the knowledge that Republican restlessness in the
Northern States would be quieted; the Federalists
who were ready, on other grounds, to come to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
standard would be encouraged to do so; and the
New England secession propaganda would be deprived
of a strong argument. He confided to the
gossipy William Plumer, the Federalist New Hampshire
Senator, that "impeachment is a farce which
will not be tried again."<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>The Chief Justice of the United States, his peril
over, was silent and again serene, his wonted composure
returned, his courage restored. He calmly
awaited the hour when the wisdom of events should
call upon him to render another and immortal service
to the American Nation. That hour was not to
be long delayed.</p>

distrust of democracy which all Federalist leaders then felt. Among
other things, he pleaded for the independence of the Judiciary, asserted
that it was their exclusive province to decide upon the constitutionality

impeached except for an offense for which he also could be indicted.

On March 23, 1802, that body transmitted articles of impeachment

to join the majority, but, unwilling to offend them, he obtained
&amp; has taken a leave of absence." (Plumer to Morse, March 10, 1804,

Burr "abruptly left the Senate" to attend to his candidacy for the

The conviction and removal of Pickering alarmed the older Federalists
almost as much as did the repeal of the Judiciary Act. "The
<i>demon</i> of party governed the decision. All who condemned were
Jeffersonians, and all who pronounced the accused not guilty were
Federalists." (Pickering to Lyman, March 4, 1804, <i>N.E. Federalism</i>:

The Republicans, for a time, contemplated the impeachment of
Richard Peters, Judge of the United States Court for the District of
Pennsylvania, who sat with Chase during the trial of Fries. (<i>Annals</i>,
8th Cong. 1st Sess. 823-24, 850, 873-74.) But his name was dropped
because he had not "so acted in his judiciary capacity as to require
the interposition of the Constitutional powers of this House." (<i>Ib.</i>
1171.)
</p><p>
Peters was terrified and turned upon his fellow judge. He showered
Pickering and other friends with letters, complaining of the conduct
of his judicial associate. "If I am to be immolated let it be with some
other Victim&mdash;or for my own Sins." (Peters to Pickering, Jan. 26,
1804, Pickering MSS. Mass. Hist. Soc.)</p></div>

</p><p>
Chase's career had been stirring and important. Carefully educated
by his father, an Episcopal clergyman, and thoroughly grounded in
the law, he became eminent at the Maryland bar at a very early age.
From the first his aggressive character asserted itself. He was rudely
independent and, as a member of the Maryland House of Burgesses,
treated the royal governor and his Tory partisans with contemptuous
defiance. When the British attempted to enforce the Stamp Act, he
joined a band of high-spirited young patriots who called themselves
"The Sons of Liberty," and led them in their raids upon public offices,
which they broke open, seizing and destroying the stamps and burning
in effigy the stamp distributor.
</p><p>
His violent and fearless opposition to British rule and officials
made young Chase so popular that he was elected as one of the five
Maryland delegates to the first Continental Congress that assembled
during the winter of 1774. He was re&euml;lected the following year, and
was foremost in urging the measures of armed defense that ended
in the appointment of Washington as Commander-in-Chief of the
American forces. Disregarding the instructions of his State, Chase
hotly championed the adoption of the Declaration of Independence,
and was one of the signers of that document.
</p><p>
On the floor of Congress he denounced a member as a traitor&mdash;one
Zubly, a Georgia parson&mdash;who in terror fled the country. Chase
continued in the Continental Congress until 1778 and was appointed
a member of almost every important committee of that body. He
became the leader of his profession in Maryland, was appointed Chief
Justice of the Criminal Court of Baltimore, and elected a member of
the Maryland Convention, called to ratify the National Constitution.
Thereafter, he was made Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the
State. In 1796, President Washington appointed Chase as Associate
Justice of the National Supreme Court of which he was conceded to
be one of the ablest members. (Dwight, 245-52.)</p></div>

Luther Martin well illustrates the fleeting nature of the fame
of even the greatest lawyers. For two generations he was "an acknowledged
leader of the American bar," and his pre&euml;minence in
that noble profession was brightened by fine public service. Yet
within a few years after his death, he was totally forgotten, and to-day
few except historical students know that such a man ever lived.
</p><p>
Martin began his practice of the law when twenty-three years of
age and his success was immediate and tremendous. His legal learning
was prodigious&mdash;his memory phenomenal.
</p><p>
Apparently, Martin was the heaviest drinker of that period of
heavy drinking men. The inexplicable feature of his continuous excesses
was that his mighty drinking seldom appeared to affect his
professional efficiency. Only once in his long and active career did
intoxication interfere with his work in court. (See <i>infra</i>, 586.)
</p><p>
Passionate in his loves and hates, he abhorred Jefferson with all
the ardor of his violent nature; and his favorite denunciation of any
bad man was, "Sir! he is as great a scoundrel as Thomas Jefferson."
</p><p>
For thirty years Martin was the Attorney-General of Maryland.
He was the most powerful member of his State in the Convention that
framed the National Constitution which he refused to sign, opposing
the ratification of it in arguments of such signal ability that forty
years afterward John C. Calhoun quarried from them the material for
his famous Nullification speeches.
</p><p>
When, however, the Constitution was ratified and became the
supreme law of the land, Martin, with characteristic wholeheartedness,
supported it loyally and championed the Administrations of
Washington and Adams.
</p><p>
He was the lifelong friend of the impeached justice, to whom he
owed his first appointment as Attorney-General of Maryland as well
as great assistance and encouragement in the beginning of his career.
Chase and he were also boon companions, each filled with admiration
for the talents and attainments of the other, and strikingly similar in
their courage and fidelity to friends and principles. So the lawyer
threw himself into the fight for the persecuted judge with all his
astonishing strength.
</p><p>
When, in his old age, he was stricken with paralysis, the Maryland
Legislature placed a tax of five dollars annually on all lawyers for his
support. After Martin's death the bench and bar of Baltimore passed
a resolution that "we will wear mourning for the space of thirty
days." (<i>American Law Review</i>, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 279.)
</p><p>
No biography of Martin has ever been written; but there are two
excellent sketches of his life, one by Ashley M. Gould in <i>Great American
Lawyers</i>: Lewis, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 3-46; and the other by Henry P. Goddard
in the <i>Md. Hist. Soc. Fund. Pub. No. 24.</i></p></div>

of all of the evidence is important and entertaining:
</p><p>
"Not only the casual expressions dropped in private conversations
among friends and intimates, as well as strangers and adversaries, in
the recess of a bed-chamber as well as at public taverns and in stage
coaches, had been carefully and malignantly laid up and preserved
for testimony on this prosecution; not only more witnesses examined
to points of <i>opinion</i>, and called upon for discrimination to such a
degree as to say whether the deportment of the Judge was <i>imperative</i>
or <i>imperious</i>, but hours of interrogation and answer were consumed
in evidence to <i>looks</i>, to <i>bows</i>, to tones of voice and modes of speech&mdash;to
prove the insufferable grievance that Mr. Chase had more than
once raised a laugh at the expense of Callender's counsel, and to ascertain
the tremendous fact that he had accosted the <span class="smcap">Attorney General</span>
<i>of Virginia</i> by the appellation of <i>Young Gentleman</i>!!
</p><p>
"If by thumbscrews, the memory of a witness trace back for a
period of five years the features of the Judge's face, it could be darkened
with a frown, it was to be construed into rude and contumelious
treatment of the Virginia bar; if it was found lightened with a smile,
'tyrants in all ages had been notorious for their pleasantry.'
</p><p>
"In short, sir, Gravity himself could not keep his countenance at
the nauseating littlenesses which were resorted to for proof of atrocious
criminality, and indignation melted into ridicule at the puerile
perseverance with which <i>nothings</i> were accumulated, with the hope of
making <i>something</i> by their multitude.
</p><p>
"All this, however, was received because Judge Chase would not
suffer his counsel to object against it. He indulged his accusers with
the utmost licence of investigation which they ever derived [<i>sic</i>], and
contented himself with observing to the court that he expected to be
judged upon the <i>legal</i> evidence in the case." (J. Q. Adams to his
father, March 8, 1805, <i>Writings, J. Q. A.</i>: Ford, <span class="smcap">iii</span>, 112-13.)</p></div>

<h3>BIOGRAPHER</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Marshall has written libels on one side. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>What seemed to him to pass for dignity, will, by his reader, be pronounced
dullness. (Edinburgh Review.)</p>

<p>That work was hurried into the world with too much precipitation. It is one
of the most desirable objects I have in this life to publish a corrected edition.
(Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>Although the collapse of the Chase impeachment
made it certain that Marshall would not be removed
from office, and he was thus relieved from one source
of sharp anxiety, two other causes of worry served
to make this period of his life harried and laborious.
His heavy indebtedness to Denny Fairfax<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> continuously
troubled him; and, worse still for his peace
of mind, he was experiencing the agonies of the
literary composer temperamentally unfitted for the
task, wholly unskilled in the art, and dealing with a
subject sure to arouse the resentment of Jefferson
and all his followers. Marshall was writing the
"Life of Washington."</p>

<p>In a sense it is fortunate for us that he did so, since
his long and tiresome letters to his publishers afford
us an intimate view of the great Chief Justice and
reveal him as very human. But the biography itself
was to prove the least satisfactory of all the labors
of Marshall's life.</p>

<p>Not long after the death of Washington, his
nephew, Bushrod Washington, had induced Marshall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to become the biographer of "the Father of his
Country." Washington's public and private papers
were in the possession of his nephew. Although it
was advertised that these priceless original materials
were to be used in this work exclusively, many
of Washington's writings had already been used by
other authors.</p>

<p>Marshall needed little urging to undertake this
monumental labor. Totally unfamiliar with the
exhausting toil required of the historian, he deemed
it no great matter to write the achievements of his
idolized leader. Moreover, he was in pressing need
of money with which to pay the remaining $31,500<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
which his brother and he still owed on the Fairfax
purchase, as well as the smaller but yet annoying
sum due their brother-in-law, Rawleigh Colston, for
his share of the estate which the Marshall brothers
had bought of him.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> To discharge these obligations,
Marshall had nothing but his salary and the income
from his lands, which were wholly insufficient to
meet the demands upon him. Some of his plantations,
in fact, were "productive only of expense &amp;
vexation."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>Marshall and Bushrod Washington made extravagant
estimates of the prospective sales of the
biography and of the money they would receive.
Everybody, they thought, would be eager to buy the
true story of the life of America's "hero and sage."
Perhaps the multitude could not afford volumes so
expensive as those Marshall was to write, but there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
would be tens of thousands of prosperous Federalists
who could be depended upon to purchase at
a generous price a definitive biography of George
Washington.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the color taken from these rosy expectations
by the enthusiasm of those who wished
to publish the biography. When it became known
that the book was to be produced, many printers
applied to Bushrod Washington "to purchase the
copyright,"<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> among them C. P. Wayne, a successful
publisher of Philadelphia, who made two propositions
to bring out the work. After a consultation
with Marshall, Bushrod Washington wrote Wayne:
"Being ignorant of such matters ... we shall therefore
decline any negotiation upon the subject for
the present."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>After nearly two years of negotiation, Marshall
and his associate decided that the biography would
require four or five volumes, and arrived at the
modest opinion that there would be "30,000 subscribers
in America.... Less than a dollar a volume
cannot be thought of," and this price should yield
to the author and his partner "$150,000, supposing
there to be five volumes. This ... would content us,
whilst it would leave a very large profit" to the
publisher. But, since the number of subscribers
could not be foretold with exactness, Marshall and
Bushrod Washington decided to "consent to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
$100,000 for the copyright in the United States";
and they sternly announced that, "less than this sum
we will not take."<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Wayne sought to reduce the optimism of Marshall
and Washington by informing them that "the
greatest number of subscribers ever obtained for
any one publication in this country was ... 2000 and
the highest sum ever paid in for the copyright of
any one work ... was 30,000 Dollars." Wayne thinks
that Marshall's work may sell better, but is sure
that more than ten thousand sets cannot be disposed
of for many years. He gives warning that, if the
biography should contain anything objectionable
to the British Government, the sale of it would be
prevented in England, as was the case with David
Ramsay's "History of the Revolution."<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>Marshall and Washington also "rec<sup>d</sup> propositions
for the purchase of the right to sell in G<sup>t.</sup> Britain,"
and so informed Wayne, calling upon him to "say
so" if he wished to acquire British, as well as American
rights, "knowing the grounds upon which we
calculate the value in the United States."<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>So we find Marshall counting on fifty thousand
dollars<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> at the very least from his adventure in the
field of letters. His financial reckoning was expansive;
but his idea of the time within which he could
write so important a history was grotesque. At first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
he counted on producing "4 or 5 volumes in octavos
of from 4 to 500 pages each" in less than one year,
provided "the present order of the Courts be not
disturbed or very materially changed."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>It thus appears that Marshall expected the Federalist
Judiciary Act of 1801 to stand; that he would
not be called upon to ride the long, tiresome, time-consuming
Southern circuit; and that, with no great
number of cases to be disposed of by the Supreme
Court, he would have plenty of leisure to write
several large volumes of history in a single year.</p>

<p>But the Republican repeal of the act gave the
disgusted Chief Justice "duties to perform," as John
Randolph expressed it. Marshall was forthwith sent
upon his circuit riding, and his fondly anticipated
relief from official labors vanished. Although he had
engaged to write the biography during the winter
following Washington's death, not one line of it had
he penned at the time the contract for publication
was made in the autumn of 1802. He had, of course,
done some reading of the various histories of the
period; but he had not even begun the examination
of Washington's papers, the subsequent study of
which proved so irksome to him.</p>

<p>After almost two years of bartering, a contract
was made with Wayne to print and sell the biography.
This agreement, executed September 22, 1802,
gave to the publisher the copyright in the United
States and all rights of the authors "in any part of
North and South America and in the West India<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Islands." The probable extent of the work was to
be "four or five volumes in Octavo, from four to five
hundred pages" each; and it was "supposed" that
these would "be compleated in less than two years"&mdash;Marshall's
original estimate of time having now
been doubled.</p>

<p>Wayne engaged to pay "one dollar for every volume
of the aforesaid work which may be subscribed
for or which may be sold and paid for." It was
further covenanted that the publisher should "not
demand" of the public "a higher price than three
dollars per volume in boards."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> This disappointed
Marshall, who had insisted that the volumes must
be sold for four dollars each, a price which Wayne
declared the people would not pay.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>It would seem that for a long time Marshall tried
to conceal the fact that he was to be the author;
and, when the first volume was about to be issued,
strenuously objected to the use of his name on the
title-page. However, Jefferson soon got wind of the
project. The alert politician took swift alarm and
promptly suggested measures to counteract the political
poison with which he was sure Marshall's pen
would infect public opinion. He consulted Madison,
and the two picked out the brilliant and versatile
Joel Barlow, then living in Paris, as the best man to
offset the evil labor in which Marshall was engaged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Madison and myself have cut out a piece
of work for you," Jefferson wrote Barlow, "which is
to write the history of the United States, from the
close of the War downwards. We are rich ourselves
in materials, and can open all the public archives to
you; but your residence here is essential, because a
great deal of the knowledge of things is not on paper,
but only within ourselves for verbal communication."</p>

<p>Then Jefferson states the reason for the "piece
of work" which he and Madison had "cut out" for
Barlow: "John Marshall is writing the life of Gen.
Washington from his papers. It is intended to come
out just in time to influence the next presidential
election." The imagination of the party manager
pictured Marshall's work as nothing but a political
pamphlet. "It is written therefore," Jefferson continues,
"principally with a view to electioneering
purposes; but it will consequently be out in time to
aid you with information as well as to point out the
perversions of truth necessary to be rectified."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>Thus Marshall's book was condemned before a
word of it had been written, and many months before
the contract with Wayne was signed&mdash;a circumstance
that was seriously to interfere with subscriptions
to the biography. Jefferson's abnormal
sensitiveness to even moderate criticism finally led
him to the preparation of the most interesting and
untrustworthy of all his voluminous papers, as a
reply to Marshall's "Washington."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>News was sent to Republicans all over the country
that Marshall's book was to be an attack upon their
party. Wayne tells Marshall and Washington of the
danger, but Washington testily assures the nervous
publisher that he need have no fear: "The democrats
may say what they please and I have expected they
would say a great deal, but this is at least not intended
to be a party work nor will any candid man
have cause to make this charge."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>The contract signed, Wayne quickly put in motion
the machinery to procure subscribers. Of this
mechanism, the most important part should have
been the postmasters, of whom Wayne expected to
make profitable use. There were twelve hundred of
them, "each acquainted with all the gentlemen
of their respective neighborhoods ... and their neighbors
would subscribe at request, when they would
not to a stranger.... All letters to and from these
men go free of postage," Wayne advised Marshall,
while assuring the anxious author that "every Post
Master in the United States holds a subscription
paper."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> But, thanks to Jefferson, the postmasters
were to prove poor salesmen of the product of
Marshall's pen.</p>

<p>Other solicitors, however, were also put to work:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
among them the picturesque Mason Locke Weems,
part Whitefield, part Villon, a delightful mingling
of evangelist and vagabond, lecturer and politician,
writer and musician.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> Weems had himself written a
"Life of Washington" which had already sold extensively
among the common people.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> He had long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
been a professional book agent with every trick of
the trade at his fingers' ends, and was perfectly acquainted
with the popular taste.</p>

<p>First, the parson-subscription agent hied himself
to Baltimore. "I average 12 sub<sup>s</sup> pr day. <i>Thank
God for that</i>," he wrote to his employer. He is on
fire with enthusiasm: "If the Work be done handsomely,
you will sell at least 20,000," he brightly
prophesies. Within a week Weems attacks the postmasters
and insists that he be allowed to secure
sub-agents from among the gentry: "The Mass of
Riches and of Population in America lie in the
Country. There is the wealthy Yeomanry; and
there the ready Thousands who w<sup>d.</sup> instantly second
you were they but duly stimulated."<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>Almost immediately Weems discovered a popular
distrust of Marshall's forthcoming volumes: "The
People are very fearful that it will be prostituted to
party purposes," he informs Wayne. "<i>For Heaven's
Sake, drop now and then a cautionary Hint to John
Marshall Esq.</i> Your all is at stake with respect to
this work. If it be done in a generally acceptable
manner you will make your fortune. Otherwise the
work will fall an Abortion from the press."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>Weems's apprehension grew. Wayne had written
that the cities would yield more subscribers than
the country. "For a moment, admit it," argues
Weems: "Does it follow that the Country is a mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
blank, a cypher not worth your notice? Because
there are 30,000 wealthy families in the City and
but 20,000 in the Country, must nothing be tried to
enlist 5000, at least of these 20,000??? If the <i>Fed<sup>s</sup>
sh<sup>d</sup> be disappointed</i>, and the Demo<sup>s</sup> disgusted with
Gen<sup>l.</sup> Marshals performance, will it not be very
convenient to have 4 to 5000 good Rustic Blades to
lighten your shelves &amp; to shovel in the Dol<sup>$</sup>."<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>The dean of book agents evidently was having a
hard time, but his resourcefulness kept pace with his
discouragement: "Patriotic Orations&mdash;Gazetter
Puffs&mdash;Washingtonian Anecdotes, Sentimental,
Moral Military and Wonderful&mdash;All sh<sup>d</sup> be Tried,"
he advises Wayne.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Again, he notes the failure of
the postmasters to sell Marshall's now much-talked-of
book. "In six months," he writes from Martinsburg,
Virginia, "the P. Master here got 1. In &frac12; day.
<i>I thank God</i>, I've got 13 sub<sup>s</sup>."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>The outlook for subscriptions was even worse in
New England. Throughout the whole land, there
was, it seems, an amazing indifference to Washington's
services to the Nation. "I am sorry to inform
you," Wayne advised Marshall and his associate,
"that the Prospect of an extensive Subscription is
gloomy in N. England, particularly they argue it is too
Expensive and wait for a cheaper Edition&mdash;'tis like
Americans, Mr. Wolcott and Mr. Pickering say they
are loud in their professions, but attempt to touch
their purses and they shut them in a moment."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing from Fredericksburg, Virginia, Weems at
last mingles cheer with warning: "Don't indulge a
fear&mdash;let no sigh of thine arise. Give <i>Old Washington
fair play</i> and all will be well. Let but the <i>Interior</i>
of the Work be Liberal &amp; the <i>Exterior Elegant</i>,
and a Town House &amp; a Country House, a Coach
and Sideboard and Massy Plate shall be thine."
Still, he declared, "I sicken when I think how much
may be marr<sup>d</sup>."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>A week later found the reverend solicitor at Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, and here the influence of politics
on the success of Marshall's undertaking again crops
out: "The place had been represented to me," records
Weems, "as a Nest of Anti Washingtonian
Hornets who w<sup>d</sup> draw their Stings at mention of
his name&mdash;and the Fed [torn] Lawyers are all gone
to York&mdash;However, I dash<sup>d</sup> in among them and
<i>thank God</i> have obtain<sup>d</sup> already 17 good names."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>By now even the slow-thinking Bushrod Washington
had become suspicious of Jefferson's postmasters:
"The postmasters being (I believe) Democrats.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
Are you sure they will feel a disposition to
advance the work?"<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Later he writes: "I would not
give one honest soliciting agent for 1250 quiescent
postmasters."<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>A year passed after the first subscriptions were
made, and not even the first volume had appeared.
Indeed, no part of the manuscript had been finished
and sent to the publisher. Wayne was exasperated.
"I am extremely anxious on this subject," he complains
to Bushrod Washington, "as the Public evince
dissatisfaction at the delay. Each hour I am questioned
either verbally or by letter relative to it &amp;
its procrastination. The subscription seems to have
received a check in consequence of an opinion that
it is uncertain when the work will go to press.
<i>Twelve thousand</i> dollars is the Total Cash yet rece<sup>d</sup>&mdash;not
quite 4,000 subscribers."<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>By November, 1803, many disgusted subscribers
are demanding a refund of the money, and Wayne
wants the contract changed to the payment of a
lump sum. The "Public [are] exclaiming against
the price of 3 Doll<sup>s</sup> per vol.," and his sanguine expectations
have evaporated: "I did hope that I
should realize <i>half</i> the number of subscribers you
contemplated, <i>thirty thousand</i>; ... but altho' <i>two active</i>,
and twelve hundred other agents have been employed
12 months, the list of names <i>does</i> not amount
to <i>one seventh</i> of the contemplated number."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne insists on purchasing the copyright "for
a <i>moderate, specifick</i> sum" so that he can save himself
from loss and "that the Publick disgust may
be removed." He has heard, he says, and quite
directly, that the British rights have been sold "at
two thousand doll<sup>s</sup>!!!"&mdash;and this in spite of the
fact that, only the previous year, Marshall and
Washington "expected <i>Seventy</i> Thousand."<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>At last, more than three years after Marshall had
decided to embark upon the uncertain sea of authorship,
he finished the first of the five volumes. And
such a mass of manuscript! "It will make <i>at least</i>
Eight hundred pages!!!!" moaned the distraught
publisher. At that rate, considering the small number
of subscribers and the greatly increased cost of
paper and labor,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Wayne would be ruined. No title-page
had been sent, and Marshall's son, who had
brought the manuscript to Philadelphia, "astonished"
Wayne by telling him "that his father's
name was not to appear in the Title."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>When Marshall learned that the publisher demanded
a title-page bearing his name, he insisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
that this was unnecessary and not required by the
copyright law. "I am unwilling," he hastened to
write Wayne, "to be named in the book or in the
clerk's office as the author of it, if it be avoidable."
He cannot tell how many volumes there will be,
or even examine, before some time in May, 1804,
Washington's papers relating to the period of his
two administrations. The first volume he wants
"denominated <i>an introduction</i>." It is too long, he
admits, and authorizes Wayne to split it, putting
all after "the peace of 1763" into the second volume.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Marshall objects again to appearing as the author:
"My repugnance to permitting my name to
appear in the title still continues, but it shall yield
to your right to make the best use you can of the
copy." He does not think that "the name of the
author being given or withheld can produce any
difference in the number of subscribers"; but, since
he does not wish to leave Wayne "in the Opinion
that a real injury has been sustained," he would
"submit scruples" to Wayne and Washington, "only
requesting that [his] name may not be given but on
mature consideration and conviction of its propriety."
In any case, Marshall declares: "I wish not
my title in the judiciary of the United States to be
annexed to it."</p>

<p>He writes at great length about punctuation, paragraphing,
capital letters, and spelling, giving minute
directions, but leaves much to Wayne's judgment.
As to spelling: "In any doubtful case I wou<sup>d</sup> de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>cidedly
prefer to follow Johnson."<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Two other long
letters about details of printing the first volume
followed. By the end of March, 1804, his second
volume was ready.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>He now becomes worried about "the inaccuracies
... the many and great defects in composition" of
the first two volumes; but "the hurried manner in
which it is press<sup>d</sup> forward renders this inevitable."
He begs Bushrod Washington to "censure and alter
freely.... You mistake me very much if you think
I rank the corrections of a friend with the bitter
sarcasms of a foe, or that I shou<sup>d</sup> feel either wounded
or chagrined at my inattentions being pointed out
by another."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>Once more the troubled author writes his associate,
this time about the spelling of "Chesapeak"
and "enterprise," the size of the second volume, and
as to "the prospects of subscribers."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Not until
June, 1804, did Marshall give the proof-sheets of
the first volume even "a hasty reading" because
of "the pressure of ... official business."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> Totally
forgotten was the agreed plan to publish maps in
a separate volume, although it was thus "stated in
the prospectus."<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> He blandly informs the exasperated
publisher that he must wait a long time after
publishing the volumes describing the Revolution
and those on the Presidency of Washington before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the manuscript of the last volume can be sent to
press&mdash;this when many subscribers were clamoring
for the return of the money they had paid, and the
public was fast losing interest in the book. Large
events had meanwhile filled the heavens of popular
interest, and George Washington's heroic figure was
already becoming dim and indistinct.</p>

<p>The proof-sheets of the second volume were now
in Marshall's hands; but the toil of writing, "super-intending
the copying," and various other avocations
"absolutely disabled" him, he insists, from
giving them any proper examination. He had no
idea that he had been so careless in his writing and
is anxious to revise the work for a second edition.
He complains of his health and says he must spend
the summer in the mountains, where, of course, he
"cannot take the papers with [him] to prosecute the
work." He will, however, read the pages of the first
two volumes while on his vacation.</p>

<p>The manuscript of the third he had finished and
sent to Bushrod Washington.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> When Wayne saw the
length of it, his Quaker blood was heated to wrath.
Did Marshall's prolixity know no limit? The first
two volumes had already cost the publisher far more
than the estimate&mdash;would not Washington persuade
Marshall to be more concise?<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>By midsummer of 1804 the first two volumes appeared.
They were a dismal performance. Nevertheless,
one or two Federalist papers praised them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and Marshall was as pleased as any youthful writer
by a first compliment. He thanks Wayne for sending
the reviews and comments on one of them: "The
very handsome critique in the 'Political and Commercial
Register' was new to me." He modestly
admits: "I cou<sup>d</sup> only regret that there was in it more
of panuegyric than was merited. The editor ... manifests
himself to be master of a style of a very superior
order and to be, of course, a very correct judge of the
composition of Others."</p>

<span class="caption">A PART OF MARSHALL&#39;S LIST OF CORRECTIONS FOR HIS LIFE OF WASHINGTON</span>
</div>

<p>Marshall is somewhat mollified that his parentage
of the biography has been revealed: "Having,
Heaven knows how reluctantly, consented against
my judgement to be known as the author of the work
in question I cannot be insensible to the opinions
entertained of it. But, I am much more solicitous
to hear the strictures upon it"&mdash;than commendation
of it&mdash;because, he says, these would point
out defects to be corrected. He asks Wayne, therefore,
to send to him at Front Royal, Virginia, "every
condemnatory criticism....  I shall not attempt to
polish every sentence; that wou<sup>d</sup> require repeated
readings &amp; a long course of time; but I wish to correct
obvious imperfections &amp; the animadversions of
others wou<sup>d</sup> aid me very much in doing so."<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p>Within three weeks Marshall had read his first
volume in the form in which it had been delivered to
subscribers, and was "mortified beyond measure
to find that it [had] been so carelessly written." He
had not supposed that so many "inelegancies ... cou<sup>d</sup>
have appeared in it," and regrets that he must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
require Wayne to reset the matter "so materially."
He informs his publisher, nevertheless, that he is
starting on his vacation in the Alleghanies; and he
promises that when he returns he "will ... review
the corrections" he has made in the first volume,
although he would "not have time to reperuse the
whole volume."<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>Not for long was the soul of the perturbed author
to be soothed with praise. He had asked for "strictures";
he soon got them. Wayne promptly sent him
a "Magazine<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> containing a piece condemnatory of
the work." Furthermore, the books were not going
well; not a copy could the publisher sell that had
not been ordered before publication. "I have all
those on hand which I printed over the number
of subscribers," Wayne sourly informs the author.</p>

<p>In response to Marshall's request for time for revision,
Wayne is now willing that he shall take all he
wishes, since "present prospects would not induce
[him] to republish," but he cautions Marshall to "let
the idea of a 2<sup>d</sup> edit. revised and corrected remain
a secret"; if the public should get wind of such a
purpose the stacks of volumes in Wayne's printing
house would never be sold. He must have the
manuscript of the "<i>fourth</i> vol. by the last of September
at furthest.... Can I have it?&mdash;or must I dismiss
my people."</p>

<p>At the same time he begs Marshall to control
his redundancy: "The first and second vols. have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
cost me (1500) fifteen hundred dollars more than
calculated!"<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>It was small wonder that Marshall's first two
bulky books, published in the early summer of 1804,
were not hailed with enthusiasm. In volume one
the name of Washington was mentioned on only two
minor occasions described toward the end.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> The
reader had to make his way through more than one
hundred thousand words without arriving even at
the cradle of the hero. The voyages of discovery, the
settlements and explorations of America, and the
history of the Colonies until the Treaty of Paris
in 1763, two years before the Stamp Act of 1765,
were treated in dull and heavy fashion.</p>

<p>The author defends his plan in the preface: No one
connected narrative tells the story of all the Colonies
and "few would ... search through the minute details";
yet this he held to be necessary to an understanding
of the great events of Washington's life.
So Marshall had gathered the accounts of the various
authorities<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> in parts of the country and in
England, and from them made a continuous history.
If there were defects in the book it was due
to "the impatience ... of subscribers" which had so
hastened him.</p>

<p>The volume is poorly done; parts are inaccurate.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
To Bacon's Rebellion are given only four pages.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
The story of the Pilgrims is fairly well told.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> A page
is devoted to Roger Williams and six sympathetic
lines tell of his principles of liberty and toleration.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
The Salem witchcraft madness is well treated.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> The
descriptions of military movements constitute the
least disappointing parts of the volume. The beginnings
of colonial opposition to British rule are tiresomely
set out; and thus at last, the reader arrives
within twelve years of Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>Marshall admits that every event of the Revolutionary
War has been told by others who had examined
Washington's "immensely voluminous correspondence,"
and that he had copied these authors,
sometimes using their very language. Still, he promises
the reader "a particular account of his [Washington's]
own life."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>One page and three lines at the beginning of the
second volume are all that Marshall gives of the ancestry,
birth, environment, upbringing, education,
and experiences of George Washington, up to the
nineteenth year of his age. On the second page the
hero, fully uniformed and accoutred, is plunged
into the French and Indian Wars. Braddock's defeat,
already described in the first volume, is repeated
and elaborated.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Six lines, closing the first
chapter, disposes of Washington in marriage and
describes the bride.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>About three pages are devoted to the Stamp Act
speeches in the British Parliament; while but one
short paragraph is given to the immortal resolutions
of Patrick Henry and the passage of them by the
Virginia House of Burgesses. Not a word describes
the "most bloody" debate over them, and Henry's
time-surviving speech is not even referred to.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> All
mention of the fact that Washington was a fellow
member with Henry and voted for the resolutions
is omitted. Henry's second epoch-making speech at
the outbreak of the Revolution is not so much as
hinted at, nor is any place found for the Virginia
Resolutions for Arming and Defense, which his unrivaled
eloquence carried.</p>

<p>The name of the supreme orator of the Revolution
is mentioned for the second time in describing the
uprising against Lord Dunmore,<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> and then Marshall
adds this footnote: "The same gentleman who had
introduced into the assembly of Virginia the original
resolution against the stamp act."<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's account of the development of the idea
of independence is scattered.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> He gives with unnecessary
completeness certain local resolutions favoring
it,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> while to the great Declaration less than
two pages<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> are assigned. It is termed "this important
paper"; and a footnote disposes of the fact
that "Mr. Jefferson, Mr. John Adams, Mr. Franklin,
Mr. Sherman, and Mr. R. R. Livingston, were appointed
to prepare this declaration; and the draft
reported by the committee has been generally at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>tributed
to Mr. Jefferson."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> A report of the talk
between Washington and Colonel Paterson of the
British Army, concerning the title by which Washington
insisted upon being addressed,<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> is given one
and one third times the space that is bestowed upon
the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Marshall is satisfactory only when dealing with
military operations. He draws a faithful picture of
the condition of the army;<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> quotes Washington's
remorseless condemnations of the militia,<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> short enlistments,
and the democratic spirit among men and
officers.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> When writing upon such topics, Marshall
is spirited; his pages are those of the soldier that,
by nature, he was.</p>

<p>The earliest objection to Marshall's first two volumes
came from American Tories, who complained
of the use of the word "enemy" as applied to the
British military forces. Wayne reluctantly calls
Marshall's attention to this. Marshall replies:
"You need make no apology for mentioning to me
the criticism of the word 'enemy.' I will endeavor
to avoid it where it can be avoided."<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Unoffended by such demands, Marshall was
deeply chagrined by other and entirely just criticisms.
Why, he asks, had not some one pointed out
to him "some of those objections ... to the plan
of the work" before he wrote any part of it? He
wishes "very sincerely" that this had been done.
He "should very readily have relinquished [his own]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
opinion ... if [he] had perceiv<sup>d</sup> that the public taste
required a different course." Thus, by implication,
he blames Wayne or Bushrod Washington, for his
own error of judgment.</p>

<p>Marshall also reproaches himself, but in doing so
he saddles on the public most of the burden of his
complaints: "I ought, indeed, to have foreseen that
the same impatience which precipitated the publication
wou<sup>d</sup> require that the life and transactions
of Mr. Washington should be immediately entered
upon." Even if he had stuck to his original plans,
still, he "ought to have departed from them so far
as to have composed the introductory volume at
leizure after the principal work was finished."</p>

<p>Marshall's "mortification" is, he says, also "increased
on account of the careless manner in which
the work has been executed." For the first time in
his life he had been driven to sustained and arduous
mental labor, and he found, to his surprise, that he
"had to learn that under the pressure of constant
application, the spring of the mind loses its elasticity....
But regrets for the past are unavailing,"
he sighs. "There will be great difficulty in retrieving
the reputation of the first volume.... I have therefore
some doubts whether it may not be as well to
drop the first volume for the present&mdash;that is not
to speak of a republication of it."</p>

<p>He assures Wayne that he need have no fears that
he will mention a revised edition, and regrets that
the third volume is also too long; his pen has run
away with him. He would shorten it if he had the
copy once more; but since that cannot be, perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Wayne might omit the last chapter. Brooding over
the "strictures" he had so confidently asked for,
he grows irritable. "Whatever might have been the
execution, the work wou<sup>d</sup> have experienced unmerited
censure. We must endeavor to rescue what
remains to be done from such [criticism] as is deserved.
I wish you to consult Mr. Washington."<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>Another very long letter from Front Royal quickly
follows. Marshall again authorizes the publisher
himself to cut the bulk of the third volume, in the
hope that it "will not be so defective.... It shall be
my care to render the 4th more fit for the public
eye." He promises Wayne that, in case of a second
edition,<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> he will shorten his interminable pages which
shall also "receive very material corrections." But
a corrected and improved edition! "On this subject
... I remain silent.... Perhaps a free expression
of my thoughts ... may add to the current which
seems to set against it." Let the public take the
first printing "before a second is spoken of."<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>Washington drew on the publisher<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> and wrote
Wayne that "the disappointment will be very great
if it is not paid." In December, 1804, Wayne sent the
first royalty. It amounted to five thousand dollars.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Our author needed money badly. "I do not wish
to press you upon the subject of further remittances
but they will be highly acceptable," Washington
tells Wayne, "particularly to Mr. Marshall, whose
arrangements I know are bottomed upon the expectation
of the money he is to receive from you."<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
In January, 1805, Wayne sent Washington another
thousand dollars&mdash;"which I have paid," says Washington,
"to Mr. Marshall as I shall also do of the
next thousand you remit."<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Thus pressed, Wayne
sends more money, and by January 1, 1805, Marshall
and Washington have received the total sum
of eight thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>Toward the end of February, 1805, Marshall completed
the manuscript of the fourth volume. He
was then in Washington, and sent two copies from
there to Philadelphia by Joseph Hopkinson, who
had just finished his notable work in the Chase impeachment
trial. "They are both in a rough state;
too rough to be sent ... but it was impossible to
have them recopied," Marshall writes Wayne. He
admits they are full of errors in capitalization,
punctuation, and spelling, but adds, "it has absolutely
been impossible to make corrections in these
respects."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> This he "fears will produce considerable
difficulty." Small wonder, with the Chase trial absorbing
his every thought and depressing him with
heavy anxiety.</p>

<p>Marshall's relief from the danger of impeachment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
is at once reflected in his correspondence with Wayne.
Two weeks after the acquittal of Chase, he placidly
informs his publisher that the fifth volume will not
be ready until the spring of 1806 at the earliest. It
is "not yet commenced," he says, "but I shall however
set about it in a few days." He explains that
there will be little time to work on the biography.
"For the ensuing twelve months I shall scarcely have
it in my power to be five in Richmond."<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Three
months later he informs Wayne that it will be "absolutely
impossible" to complete the final volume by
the time mentioned. "I regret this very seriously
but it is a calamity for which there is no remedy."</p>

<p>The cause of this irremediable calamity was "a
tour of the mountains"&mdash;a journey to be made
"for [his] own health and that of [his] family" from
which he "cannot return till October." He still
"laments sincerely that an introductory volume was
written because [he] finds it almost impossible to
compress the civil administration into a single volume.
In doing it," he adds, "I shall be compelled to
omit several interesting transactions &amp; to mutilate
others."<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>At last Marshall's eyes are fully opened to what
should have been plain to him from the first. Nobody
wanted a tedious history of the discovery and
settlement of America and of colonial development,
certainly not from his pen. The subject had been
dealt with by more competent authors.</p>

<p>But the terrible years following the war, the Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>stitutional
period, the Administrations of Washington
and the first half of that of Adams, the decisive
part played by Washington throughout this critical
time of founding and constructing&mdash;all these were
virgin fields. They constituted, too, as vital an
epoch in American history as the Revolution itself.
Marshall's own life had been an important part of
it, and he was not unequipped to give it adequate
treatment.</p>

<p>Had Marshall written of these years, it is probable
that the well-to-do Federalists alone would have
purchased the thirty thousand sets that Marshall
originally counted on to be sold. He would have
made all the money he had expected, done a real
public service, and achieved a solid literary fame.
His "Life of Washington" might have been the
great social, economic, political, and Constitutional
history of the foundation processes of the Government
of the American Nation. His entire five
volumes would not have been too many for such
a work.</p>

<p>But all this matter relating to the formative years
of the Nation must now be crowded between two
covers and offered to an indifferent, if not hostile,
public&mdash;a public already "disgusted," as the publisher
truly declared, by the unattractive rehash of
what had already been better told.</p>

<p>Wayne again presses for a change in the contract;
he wants to buy outright Marshall's and Washington's
interests, and end the bankrupting royalty he
is paying them: "If you were willing to take 70000$
for 30000 Sub<sup>s</sup> I thought it would not be deemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
illiberal in offering twenty thousand dollars for four
thousand subscribers&mdash;this was two-sevenths of
the original sum for less than <i>one-seventh</i> of the subscribers
contemplated." Wayne asks Marshall and
Washington to "state the lowest sum" they will
take. Subscriptions have stopped, and in three
years he has sold only "<i>two copies</i> ... to non-subscribers."
But the harried publisher sends two
thousand dollars more of royalty.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1805, upon returning from his
annual vacation, Marshall is anxious to get to work,
and he must have the <i>Aurora</i> and <i>Freneau's Gazette</i>
quickly. His "official duties recommence ... on the
22<sup>d</sup> of November from which time they continue 'till
the middle of March." Repeating his now favorite
phrase, he says, "It is absolutely impossible to get
the residue of the work completed in the short time
which remains this fall." He has been sorely vexed
and is a cruelly overworked man: "The unavoidable
delays which have been experienced, the immense
researches among volumes of manuscript, &amp; chests
of letters &amp; gazettes which I am compelled to make
will impede my progress so much that it is absolutely
impossible" to finish the book at any early date.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>Want of money continually embarrasses Marshall:
"What payments my good Sir, will it be in your
power to make us in the course of this &amp; the next
month?" Bushrod Washington asks Wayne. "I
am particularly anxious," he explains, "on account
of Mr. M.... His principal dependence is upon this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
fund."<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Marshall now gets down to earnest and
continuous labor and by July, 1806, actually finishes
the fifth and only important volume of the biography.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>During all these years the indefatigable Weems
continued his engaging career as book agent, and,
like the subscribers he had ensnared, became first
the victim of hope deferred and then of unrealized
expectations. The delay in the publication of Marshall's
first volumes and the disfavor with which the
public received them when finally they appeared,
had, it seems, cooled the ardor of the horseback-and-saddlebag
distributor of literary treasures. At all
events, he ceases to write his employer about Marshall's
"Life of Washington," but is eager for other
books.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Twice only, in an interval of two years, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
mentions Marshall's biography, but without spirit
or enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> In the autumn of 1806, he querulously
refers to Marshall and Washington: "I did not
call on <i>you</i> [Wayne] for increase of Diurnal Salary.
I spoke to Judge W. I hope and expect that he and
Gen. M.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> will do me something."</p>

<p>Marshall's third volume, which had now appeared,
is an improvement on the first two. In it he
continues his narrative of the Revolutionary War
until 1779, and his statement of economic and financial
conditions<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> is excellent. The account of the
battles of Brandywine and Germantown, in both of
which he had taken part,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> is satisfactory,<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> and his
picture of the army in retreat is vivid.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> He faithfully
relates the British sentiment among the people.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
Curiously enough, he is not comprehensive or stirring
in his story of Valley Forge.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> His descriptions
of Lafayette and Baron von Steuben are worthy.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>
Again and again he attacks the militia,<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> and is merciless
in his criticism of the slip-shod, happy-go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>-lucky
American military system. These shortcomings
were offset, he says, only by the conduct of the
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> The treatment of American prisoners is
set forth in somber words,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> and he gives almost a
half-page of text<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> and two and a half pages of appendix<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
to the murder of Miss McCrea.</p>

<p>The story of the battle of Monmouth in which
Marshall took part is told with spirit.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Nineteen
pages<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> are devoted to the history of the alliance with
the French monarch, and no better r&eacute;sum&eacute; of that
event, so fruitful of historic results, ever has been
given. The last chapter describes the arrival of the
British Commission of Conciliation, the propositions
made by them, the American answer, the British attempts
to bribe Congress,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> followed by the Indian
atrocities of which the appalling massacres at Kingston
and Wyoming were the worst.</p>

<p>The long years of writing, the neglect and crudity
of his first efforts, and the self-reproval he underwent,
had their effect upon Marshall's literary craftsmanship.
This is noticeable in his fourth volume,
which is less defective than those that preceded it.
His delight in verbiage, so justly ridiculed by Cal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>lender
in 1799,<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> is a little subdued, and his sense of
proportion is somewhat improved. He again criticizes
the American military system and traces its
defects to local regulations.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> The unhappy results of
the conflict of State and Nation are well presented.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>The most energetic narrative in the volume is that
of the treason of Benedict Arnold. In telling this
story, Marshall cannot curb the expression of his
intense feeling against this "traitor, a sordid traitor,
first the slave of his rage, then purchased with
gold." Marshall does not economize space in detailing
this historic betrayal of America,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> imperative as
the saving of every line had become.</p>

<p>He relates clearly the circumstances that caused
the famous compact between Denmark, Sweden,
and Russia known as "The Armed Neutrality,"
formed in order to check Great Britain's power on
the seas. This was the first formidable assertion
of the principle of equality among nations on the
ocean. Great Britain's declaration of war upon Holland,
because that country was about to join "The
Armed Neutrality," and because Holland appeared
to be looking with favor upon a commercial treaty
which the United States wished to conclude with
her, is told with dispassionate lucidity.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>Marshall gives a compact and accurate analysis&mdash;by
far the best work he has done in the whole four volumes&mdash;of
the party beginnings discernible when
the clouds of the Revolutionary War began to break.
He had now written more than half a million words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and this description was the first part of his work
that could be resented by the Republicans. The
political division was at bottom economic, says
Marshall&mdash;those who advocated honest payment
of public debts were opposed by those who favored
repudiation; and the latter were also against military
establishments and abhorred the idea of any
National Government.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>The fourth volume ends with the mutiny of part
of the troops, the suppression of it, Washington's
farewell to his officers, and his retirement when
peace was concluded.</p>

<p>Marshall's final volume was ready for subscribers
and the public in the autumn of 1807, just one year
before the Federalist campaign for the election of
Jefferson's successor&mdash;four years later than Jefferson
had anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> It was the only political part
of Marshall's volumes, but it had not the smallest
effect upon the voters in the Presidential contest.</p>

<p>Neither human events nor Thomas Jefferson had
waited upon the convenience of John Marshall. The
Federalist Party was being reduced to a grumbling
company of out-of-date gentlemen, leaders in a
bygone day, together with a scattered following
who, from force of party habit, plodded along after
them, occasionally encouraged by some local circumstance
or fleeting event in which they imagined an
"issue" might be found. They had become anti-National,
and, in their ardor for Great Britain, had
all but ceased to be American. They had repudiated
democracy and assumed an attitude of insolent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
superiority, mournful of a glorious past, despairing
of a worthy future.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>Marshall could not hope to revive the fast weakening
Federalist organization. The most that he
could do was to state the principles upon which opposing
parties had been founded, and the determinative
conflicts that had marked the evolution of them
and the development of the American Nation. He
could only set forth, in plain and simple terms, those
antagonistic ideas which had created party divisions;
and although the party to which one group
of those ideas had given life was now moribund,
they were ideas, nevertheless, which would inevitably
create other parties in the future.</p>

<p>The author's task was, therefore, to deal not only
with the years that had gone; but, through his treatment
of the past, with the years that were to come.
He must expound the philosophy of Nationalism as
opposed to that of Localism, and must enrich his exposition
by the unwritten history of the period between
the achievement of American Independence
and the vindication of it in our conflict with France.</p>

<p>Marshall was infinitely careful that every statement
in his last volume should be accurate; and, to
make sure of this, he wrote many letters to those who
had first-hand knowledge of the period. Among
others he wrote to John Adams, requesting permission
to use his letters to Washington. Adams readily
agreed, although he says, "they were written
under great agitation of mind at a time when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
cruel necessity compelled me to take measures
which I was very apprehensive would produce the
evils which have followed from them. If you have
detailed the events of the last years of General
Washington's Life, you must have run the Gauntlet
between two infuriated factions, armed with scorpions....
It is a period which must however be investigated,
but I am very confident will never be
well understood."<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>Because of his lack of a sense of proportion in
planning his "Life of Washington," and the voluminousness
of the minor parts of it, Marshall had to
compress the vital remainder. Seldom has a serious
author been called upon to execute an undertaking
more difficult. Marshall accomplished the feat in
creditable fashion. Moreover, his fairness, restraint,
and moderation, even in the treatment of subjects
regarding which his own feelings were most ardent,
give to his pages not only the atmosphere of justice,
but also something of the artist's touch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington's Nationalism is promptly and skillfully
brought into the foreground.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> An excellent account
of the Society of the Cincinnati contains the
first covert reflection on Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> But the state of
the country under the Articles of Confederation is
passed over with exasperating brevity&mdash;only a few
lines are given to this basic subject.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>The foundation of political parties is stated once
more and far better&mdash;"The one ... contemplated
America as a nation," while "the other attached
itself to state authorities." The first of these was
made up of "men of enlarged and liberal minds ...
who felt the full value of national honour, and the
full obligation of national faith; and who were
persuaded of the insecurity of both, if resting for
their preservation on the concurrence of thirteen
distinct sovereignties"; and with these far-seeing
and upright persons were united the "officers of the
army" whose experience in war had weakened "local
prejudices."<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>Thus, by mentioning the excellence of the members
of one party, and by being silent upon the shortcomings
of those of the other party, Marshall
imputes to the latter the reverse of those qualities
which he praises&mdash;a method practiced throughout
the book, and one which offended Jefferson and
his followers more than a direct attack could have
done.</p>

<p>He succinctly reviews the attempts at union,<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> and
the disputes between America and Great Britain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
over the Treaty of Peace;<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> he quickly swings back to
the evolution of political parties and, for the third
time, reiterates his analysis of debtor and Localist as
against creditor and Nationalist.</p>

<p>"The one [party] struggled ... for the exact observance
of public and private engagements"; to
them "the faith of a nation, or of a private man
was deemed a sacred pledge." These men believed
that "the distresses of individuals" could be relieved
only by work and faith, "not by a relaxation of the
laws, or by a sacrifice of the rights of others." They
thought that "the imprudent and idle could not be
protected by the legislature from the consequences
of their indiscretion; but should be restrained from
involving themselves in difficulties, by the conviction
that a rigid compliance with contracts would be enforced."
Men holding these views "by a natural association
of ideas" were "in favour of enlarging the
powers of the federal government, and of enabling it
to protect the dignity and character of the nation
abroad, and its interests at home."<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>With these principles Marshall sharply contrasts
those of the other party: "Viewing with extreme
tenderness the case of the debtor, their efforts were
unceasingly directed to his relief"; they were against
"a faithful compliance with contracts"&mdash;such a
measure they thought "too harsh to be insisted on ...
and one which the people would not bear." Therefore,
they favored "relaxing ... justice," suspending
the collection of debts, remitting taxes. These men
resisted every attempt to transfer from their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
hands into those of Congress all powers that were, in
reality, National. Those who held to such "lax notions
of honor," were, in many States, "a decided
majority of the people," and were very powerful
throughout the country. Wherever they secured
control, paper money, delay of justice, suspended
taxes "were the fruits of their rule"; and where they
were in the minority, they fought at every election
for the possession of the State Governments.</p>

<p>In this fashion Marshall again states those antipodal
philosophies from which sprang the first
two American political parties. With something like
skill he emphasizes the conservative and National
idea thus: "No principle had been introduced [in the
State Governments] which could resist the wild projects
of the moment, give the people an opportunity
to reflect, and allow the good sense of the nation
time for exertion." The result of "this instability in
principles which ought if possible to be rendered
immutable, produced a long train of ills."<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> The
twin spirits of repudiation and Localism on one side,
contending for the mastery against the companion
spirits of faith-keeping and Nationalism on the
other, were from the very first, says Marshall, the
source of public ill-being or well-being, as one or
the other side prevailed.</p>

<p>Then follows a review of the unhappy economic
situation which, as Marshall leaves the reader to infer,
was due exclusively to the operation of the principles
which he condemns by the mere statement
of them.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> So comes the Philadelphia Convention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of 1787 that was deemed by many "an illegitimate
meeting."<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>Although Washington presided over, and was the
most powerful influence in, the Constitutional Convention,
Marshall allots only one short paragraph
to that fact.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> He enumerates the elements that
prepared to resist the Constitution; and brings out
clearly the essential fact that the proposed government
of the Nation was, by those who opposed it,
considered to be "foreign." He condenses into less
than two pages his narrative of the conflict over
ratification, and almost half of these few lines is devoted
to comment upon "The Federalist."</p>

<p>Marshall writes not one line or word of Washington's
power and activities at this critical moment.
He merely observes, concerning ratification, that
"the intrinsic merits of the instrument would not
have secured" the adoption of the Constitution, and
that even in some of the States that accepted it "a
majority of the people were in the opposition."<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>He tells of the pressure on Washington to accept
the Presidency. To these appeals and Washington's
replies, he actually gives ten times more space than
he takes to describe the formation, submission, and
ratification of the Constitution itself.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> After briefly
telling of Washington's election to the Presidency,
Marshall employs twenty pages in describing his
journey to New York and his inauguration.</p>

<p>Then, with quick, bold strokes, he lays the final<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
color on his picture of the state of the country before
the new government was established, and darkens
the tints of his portrayal of those who were
opposing the Constitution and were still its enemies.
In swift contrast he paints the beginnings of better
times, produced by the establishment of the new
National Government: "The new course of thinking
which had been inspired by the adoption of a constitution
that was understood to prohibit all laws
impairing the obligation of contracts, had in a great
measure restored that confidence which is essential
to the internal prosperity of nations."<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>He sets out adequately the debates over the first
laws passed by Congress,<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> and is generous in his
description of the characters and careers of both
Jefferson and Hamilton when they accepted places
in Washington's first Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> He joyfully quotes
Washington's second speech to Congress, in which
he declares that "to be prepared for war is one of
the most effectual means of preserving peace"; and
in which the people are adjured "to discriminate the
spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness."<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>An analysis of Hamilton's First Report on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Public Credit follows. The measures flowing from it
"originated the first regular and systematic opposition
to the principles on which the affairs of the
union were administered."<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> In condensing the momentous
debate over the establishment of the American
financial system, Marshall gives an excellent
summary of the arguments on both sides of that
controversy. He states those of the Nationalists,
however, more fully than the arguments of those
who opposed Hamilton's plan.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>While attributing to Hamilton's financial measures
most of the credit for improved conditions,
Marshall frankly admits that other causes contributed
to the new-found prosperity: By "progressive
industry, ... the influence of the constitution on
habits of thinking and acting," and especially by
"depriving the states of the power to impair the
obligation of contracts, or to make any thing but
gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, the
conviction was impressed on that portion of society
which had looked to the government for relief from
embarrassment, that personal exertions alone could
free them from difficulties; and an increased degree
of industry and economy was the natural consequence."<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most colorful pages of Marshall's entire
work are those in which he describes the effect of
the French Revolution on America, and the popular
hostility to Washington's Proclamation of Neutrality<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and to the treaty with Great Britain negotiated by
John Jay.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>In his treatment of these subjects he reveals some
of the sources of his distrust of the people. The
rupture between the United States and the French
Republic is summarized most inadequately. The
greatest of Washington's state papers, the immortal
"Farewell Address,"<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> is reproduced in full. The account
of the X. Y. Z. mission is provokingly incomplete;
that of American preparations for war with
France is less disappointing. Washington's illness
and death are described with feeling, though in
stilted language; and Marshall closes his literary
labors with the conventional analysis of Washington's
character which the world has since accepted.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's fifth volume was received with delight
by the disgruntled Federalist leaders. A letter of
Chancellor James Kent is typical of their comments.
"I have just finished ... the last Vol. of Washington's
Life and it is worth all the rest. It is an excellent
History of the Government and Parties in this
country from Vol. 3 to the death of the General."<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>Although it had appeared too late to do them any
harm at the election of 1804, the Republicans and
Jefferson felt outraged by Marshall's history of the
foundation period of the Government. Jefferson said
nothing for a time, but the matter was seldom out
of his thoughts. Barlow, it seems, had been laggard
in writing a history from the Republican point of
view, as Jefferson had urged him to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Three years had passed since the request had
been made, and Barlow was leaving for Paris upon
his diplomatic mission. Jefferson writes his congratulations,
"yet ... not unmixed with regret. What is
to become of our past revolutionary history? Of
the antidotes of truth to the misrepresentations of
Marshall?"<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>Time did not lessen Jefferson's bitterness: "Marshall
has written libels on one side,"<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> he writes
Adams, with whom a correspondence is opening, the
approach of old age having begun to restore good
relations between these former enemies. Jefferson's
mind dwells on Marshall's work with increasing anxiety:
"On the subject of the history of the American
Revolution ... who can write it?" he asks. He
speaks of Botta's "History,"<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> criticizing its defects;
but he concludes that "the work is nevertheless a
good one, more judicious, more chaste, more classical,
and more true than the party diatribe of Marshall.
Its greatest fault is in having taken too much
from him."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's "party diatribe" clung like a burr in
Jefferson's mind and increased his irritation with the
passing of the years. Fourteen years after Marshall's
last volume appeared, Justice William Johnson of
the Supreme Court published an account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
period<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> covered by Marshall's work, and it was
severely criticized in the <i>North American Review</i>.
Jefferson cheers the despondent author and praises
his "inestimable" history: "Let me ... implore you,
dear Sir, to finish your history of parties.... We
have been too careless of our future reputation, while
our tories will omit nothing to place us in the wrong."
For example, Marshall's "Washington," that "five-volumed
libel, ... represents us as struggling for
office, and not at all to prevent our government
from being administered into a monarchy."<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>In his long introduction to the "Anas," Jefferson
explains that he would not have thought many of
his notes "worth preserving but for their testimony
against the only history of that period which pretends
to have been compiled from authentic and
unpublished documents." Had Washington himself
written a narrative of his times from the materials
he possessed, it would, of course, have been truthful:
"But the party feeling of his biographer, to whom
after his death the collection was confided, has
culled from it a composition as different from what
Genl. Washington would have offered, as was the
candor of the two characters during the period of
the war.</p>

<p>"The partiality of this pen is displayed in lavishments
of praise on certain military characters, who
had done nothing military, but who afterwards, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>&amp;
before he wrote, had become heroes in party, altho'
not in war; and in his reserve on the merits of
others, who rendered signal services indeed, but did
not earn his praise by apostatising in peace from the
republican principles for which they had fought in
war."</p>

<p>Marshall's frigidity toward liberty "shews itself
too," Jefferson continues, "in the cold indifference
with which a struggle for the most animating of
human objects is narrated. No act of heroism ever
kindles in the mind of this writer a single aspiration
in favor of the holy cause which inspired the bosom,
&amp; nerved the arm of the patriot warrior. No gloom
of events, no lowering of prospects ever excites a
fear for the issue of a contest which was to change
the condition of man over the civilized globe.</p>

<p>"The sufferings inflicted on endeavors to vindicate
the rights of humanity are related with all the frigid
insensibility with which a monk would have contemplated
the victims of an <i>auto da f&eacute;</i>. Let no man
believe that Gen. Washington ever intended that
his papers should be used for the suicide of the cause,
for which he had lived, and for which there never
was a moment in which he would not have died."</p>

<p>Marshall's "abuse of these materials," Jefferson
charges, "is chiefly however manifested in the history
of the period immediately following the establishment
of the present constitution; and nearly
with that my memorandums [the "Anas"] begin.
Were a reader of this period to form his idea of it
from this history alone, he would suppose the republican
party (who were in truth endeavoring to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
keep the government within the line of the Constitution,
and prevent it's being monarchised in
practice) were a mere set of grumblers, and disorganisers,
satisfied with no government, without fixed
principles of any, and, like a British parliamentary
opposition, gaping after loaves and fishes, and ready
to change principles, as well as position, at any time,
with their adversaries."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson denounces Hamilton and his followers as
"monarchists," "corruptionists," and other favorite
Jeffersonian epithets, and Marshall is again assailed:
"The horrors of the French revolution, then raging,
aided them mainly, and using that as a raw head and
bloody bones they were enabled by their stratagems
of X. Y. Z. in which this historian was a leading
mountebank, their tales of tub-plots, Ocean massacres,
bloody buoys, and pulpit lyings, and slanderings,
and maniacal ravings of their Gardiners, their
Osgoods and Parishes, to spread alarm into all but
the firmest breasts."<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>Criticisms of Marshall's "Life of Washington"
were not, however, confined to Jefferson and the
Republicans. Plumer thought the plan of the work
"preposterous."<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> The Reverend Samuel Cooper
Thatcher of Boston reviewed the biography through
three numbers of the <i>Monthly Anthology</i>.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> "Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
reader is surprized to find," writes Mr. Thatcher,
"the history of North America, instead of the life of
an individual.... He [Washington] is always presented
... in the pomp of the military or civil costume,
and never in the ease and undress of private
life." However, he considers Marshall's fifth volume
excellent. "We have not heard of a single denial of
his fidelity.... In this respect ... his work [is] <i>unique</i>
in the annals of political history."</p>

<p>Thatcher concludes that Marshall's just and balanced
treatment of his subject is not due to a care
for his own reputation: "We are all so full of agitation
and effervescence on political topicks, that a
man, who keeps his temper, can hardly gain a hearing."
Indeed, he complains of Marshall's fairness:
he writes as a spectator, instead of as "one, who
has himself descended into the arena ... and is yet
red with the wounds which he gave, and smarting
with those which his enemies inflicted in return";
but the reviewer charges that these volumes are
full of "barbarisms" and "grammatical impurities,"
"newspaper slang," and "unmeaning verbiage."</p>

<p>The Reverend Timothy Flint thought that Marshall's
work displayed more intellect and labor than
"eloquence and interest."<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> George Bancroft, reviewing
Sparks's "Washington," declared that "all that
is contained in Marshall is meagre and incomplete in
comparison."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Even the British critics were not so
harsh as the <i>New York Evening Post</i>, which pronounced
the judgment that if the biography "bears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
any traces of its author's uncommon powers of
mind, it is in the depths of dulness which he explored."<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>The British critics were, of course, unsparing.
The <i>Edinburgh Review</i> called Marshall's work "unpardonably
deficient in all that constitutes the soul
and charm of biography.... We look in vain,
through these stiff and countless pages, for any
sketch or anecdote that might fix a distinguishing
feature of private character in the memory.... What
seemed to pass with him for dignity, will, by his
reader, be pronounced dullness and frigidity."<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> asserted that Marshall's
"Life of Washington" was "a great, heavy book....
One gets tired and sick of the very name of Washington
before he gets half through these ... prodigious
... octavos."<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was somewhat compensated for the criticisms
of his work by an event which soon followed
the publication of his last volume. On August 29,
1809, he was elected a corresponding member of
the Massachusetts Historical Society. In a singularly
graceful letter to John Eliot, corresponding
secretary of the Society at that time, Marshall expresses
his thanks and appreciation.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>As long as he lived, Marshall worried over his
biography of Washington. When anybody praised it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
he was as appreciative as a child. In 1827, Archibald
D. Murphey eulogized Marshall's volumes in an oration,
a copy of which he sent to the Chief Justice,
who thanks Murphey, and adds: "That work was
hurried into a world with too much precipitation,
but I have lately given it a careful examination
and correction. Should another edition appear, it will
be less fatiguing, and more worthy of the character
which the biographer of Washington ought to sustain."<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Toilsomely he kept at his self-imposed task of revision.
In 1816, Bushrod Washington wrote Wayne
to send Marshall "the last three volumes in sheets
(the two first he has) that he may devote this winter
to their correction."<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>When, five years later, the Chief Justice learned
that Wayne was actually considering the risk of
bringing out a new edition, Marshall's delight was
unbounded. "It is one of the most desirable objects
I have in this life to publish a corrected edition
of that work. I would not on any terms, could I
prevent it, consent that one other set of the first
edition should be published."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in 1832, the revised biography was published.
Marshall clung to the first volume, which was
issued separately under the title "History of the
American Colonies." The remaining four volumes
were, seemingly, reduced to two; but they were so
closely printed and in such comparatively small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
type that the real condensation was far less than it
appeared to be. The work was greatly improved,
however, and is to this day the fullest and most
trustworthy treatment of that period, from the conservative
point of view.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately for Marshall, the work required of
him on the Bench gave him ample leisure to devote
to his literary venture. During the years he consumed
in writing his "Life of Washington" he wrote
fifty-six opinions in cases decided in the Circuit
Court at Richmond, and in twenty-seven cases determined
by the Supreme Court. Only four of them<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
are of more than casual interest, and but three of
them<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> are of any historical consequence. All the
others deal with commercial law, practice, rules of
evidence, and other familiar legal questions. In only
one case, that of Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, was he called
upon to deliver an opinion that affected the institutions
and development of the Nation.</p>

history. He was born in Maryland, and was one of a family of nineteen
children. He was educated in London as a physician, but abandoned
medicine for the Church, and served for several years as rector
of two or three little Episcopal churches in Maryland and ministered
occasionally at Pohick Church, in Truro Parish (sometimes called
Mount Vernon Parish), Virginia. In this devout occupation he could
not earn enough to support his very large family. So he became a
professional book agent&mdash;the greatest, perhaps, of that useful fraternity.
</p><p>
On horseback he went wherever it seemed possible to sell a book,
his samples in his saddlebags. He was a natural orator, a born entertainer,
an expert violinist; and these gifts he turned to good account
in his book-selling activities.
</p><p>
If a political meeting was to be held near any place he happened
upon, Weems would hurry to it, make a speech, and advertise his
wares. A religious gathering was his joy; there he would preach and
exhort&mdash;and sell books. Did young people assemble for merrymaking,
Weems was in his element, and played the fiddle for the dancing.
If he arrived at the capital of a State when the Legislature
was in session, he would contrive to be invited to address the Solons&mdash;and
procure their subscriptions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_611_611" id="Footnote_611_611"></a><a href="#FNanchor_611_611"><span class="label">[611]</span></a> Weems probably knew more of the real life of the country, from
Pennsylvania southward, than any other one man; and he thoroughly
understood American tastes and characteristics. To this is due the
unparalleled success of his <i>Life of Washington</i>. In addition to this
absurd but engaging book, Weems wrote the <i>Life of Gen. Francis
Marion</i> (1805); the <i>Life of Benjamin Franklin</i> (1817); and the <i>Life
of William Penn</i> (1819). He was also the author of several temperance
pamphlets, the most popular of which was the <i>Drunkard's
Looking Glass</i>. Weems died in 1825.
</p><p>
Weems's <i>Life of Washington</i> still enjoys a good sale. It has been one
of the most widely purchased and read books in our history, and has
profoundly influenced the American conception of Washington. To
it we owe the grotesque and wholly imaginary stories of young Washington
and the cherry tree, the planting of lettuce by his father to

An interesting sidelight on the commercial methods of the times is
displayed by a circular which Wayne sent to his agents calling for
money from subscribers to Marshall's <i>Life of Washington</i>: "The remittance
may be made through the Post Office, and should any danger
be apprehended, you can cut a Bank note in two parts and send each
by separate mails." (Wayne's Circular, Feb. 17, 1803, Dreer MSS.
<i>loc. cit.</i>)</p></div>

of the most prominent Federalists and of the leading Republican
politicians of the time. "T. Jefferson, P.U.S." and each member of
his Cabinet subscribed; Marshall himself was a subscriber for his
own book, and John C. Calhoun, a student at Yale College at the
time, was another. In the cities most of the lawyers took Marshall's
book.</p></div>

It would seem from this letter that Marshall and Washington had
reduced their lump cash price from $100,000 to $70,000. In stating
his expenses, Wayne says that the painter "Gilbert Stuart demanded
a handsome sum for the privilege of Engraving from his Original"
portrait of Washington.</p></div>

</p><p>
This letter is most important. Adams pictures his situation when
President: "A first Magistrate of a great Republick with a General
officer under him, a Commander in Chief of the Army, who had ten
thousand times as much Influence Popularity and Power as himself,
and that Commander in Chief so much under the influence of his
Second in command [Hamilton], ... the most treacherous, malicious,
insolent and revengeful enemy of the first Magistrate is a Picture
which may be very delicate and dangerous to draw. But it must be
drawn....
</p><p>
"There is one fact ... which it will be difficult for posterity to believe,
and that is that the measures taken by Senators, Members of
the House, some of the heads of departments, and some officers of the
Army to force me to appoint General Washington ... proceeded not
from any regard to him ... but merely from an intention to employ
him as an engine to elevate Hamilton to the head of affairs civil as
well as military."</p></div>

<h3>THE BURR CONSPIRACY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My views are such as every man of honor and every good citizen must
approve. (Aaron Burr.)</p>

<p>His guilt is placed beyond question. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>I never believed him to be a Fool. But he must be an Idiot or a Lunatic if he
has really planned and attempted to execute such a Project as is imputed to
him. But if his guilt is as clear as the Noonday Sun, the first Magistrate ought
not to have pronounced it so before a Jury had tryed him. (John Adams.)</p></div>


<p>On March 2, 1805, not long after the hour of noon,
every Senator of the United States was in his seat in
the Senate Chamber. All of them were emotionally
affected&mdash;some were weeping.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> Aaron Burr had
just finished his brief extemporaneous address<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> of
farewell. He had spoken with that grave earnestness
so characteristic of him.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> His remarks produced a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
curious impression upon the seasoned politicians and
statesmen, over whose deliberations he had presided
for four years. The explanation is found in Burr's
personality quite as much as in the substance of his
speech. From the unprecedented scene in the Senate
Chamber when the Vice-President closed, a stranger
would have judged that this gifted personage held
in his hands the certainty of a great and brilliant
career. Yet from the moment he left the Capital,
Aaron Burr marched steadily toward his doom.</p>

<p>An understanding of the trial of Aaron Burr and
of the proceedings against his agents, Bollmann and
Swartwout, is impossible without a knowledge of the
events that led up to them; while the opinions and
rulings of Chief Justice Marshall in those memorable
controversies are robbed of their color and much of
their meaning when considered apart from the picturesque
circumstances that produced them. This
chapter, therefore, is an attempt to narrate and condense
the facts of the Burr conspiracy in the light of
present knowledge of them.</p>

<p>Although in a biography of John Marshall it
seems a far cry to give so much space to that episode,
the import of the greatest criminal trial in American
history is not to be fully grasped without a summary
of the events preceding it. Moreover, the fact
that in the Burr trial Marshall destroyed the law
of "constructive treason" requires that the circumstances
of the Burr adventure, as they appeared to
Marshall, be here set forth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">AARON BURR</span>
</div>

<p>A strong, brave man who, until then, had served
his country well, Aaron Burr was in desperate
plight when on the afternoon of March 2 he walked
along the muddy Washington streets toward his
lodging. He was a ruined man, financially, politically,
and in reputation. Fourteen years of politics
had destroyed his once extensive law practice and
plunged him hopelessly into debt. The very men
whose political victory he had secured had combined
to drive him from the Republican Party.</p>

<p>The result of his encounter with Hamilton had
been as fatal to his standing with the Federalists,
who had but recently fawned upon him, as it was
to the physical being of his antagonist. What now
followed was as if Aaron Burr had been the predestined
victim of some sinister astrology, so utterly
did the destruction of his fortunes appear to be the
purpose of a malign fate.</p>

<p>His fine ancestry now counted for nothing with
the reigning politicians of either party. None of
them cared that he came of a family which, on both
sides, was among the worthiest in all the country.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
His superb education went for naught. His brilliant
services as one of the youngest Revolutionary officers
were no longer considered&mdash;his heroism at
Quebec, his resourcefulness on Putnam's staff, his
valor at Monmouth, his daring and tireless efficiency
at West Point and on the Westchester lines, were, to
these men, as if no such record had ever been written.</p>

<p>Nor, with those then in power, did Burr's notable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
public services in civil life weigh so much as a feather
in his behalf. They no longer remembered that only
a few years earlier he had been the leader of his
party in the National Senate, and that his appointment
to the then critically important post of Minister
to France had been urged by the unanimous
caucus of his political associates in Congress. None
of the notable honors that admirers had asserted
to be his due, nor yet his effective work for his party,
were now recalled. The years of provocation<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
had led, in an age of dueling,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> to a challenge of his
remorseless personal, professional, and political enemy
were now unconsidered in the hue and cry raised
when his shot, instead of that of his foe, proved
mortal.</p>

<p>Yet his spirit was not broken. His personal friends
stood true; his strange charm was as potent as ever
over most of those whom he met face to face; and
throughout the country there were thousands who
still admired and believed in Aaron Burr. Particularly
in the West and in the South the general sentiment
was cordial to him; many Western Senators
were strongly attached to him; and most of his
brother officers of the Revolution who had settled
beyond the Alleghanies were his friends.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Also, he
was still in vigorous middle life, and though delicate
of frame and slight of stature, was capable of greater
physical exertion than most men of fewer years.</p>

<p>What now should the dethroned political leader
do? Events answered that question for him, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>beckoned forward by an untimely ambition, he followed
the path that ended amid dramatic scenes in
Richmond, Virginia, where John Marshall presided
over the Circuit Court of the United States.</p>

<p>Although at the time Jefferson had praised what
he called Burr's "honorable and decisive conduct"<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>
during the Presidential contest in the House in February
of 1801, he had never forgiven his associate
for having received the votes of the Federalists,
nor for having missed, by the merest chance, election
as Chief Magistrate.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Notwithstanding that
Burr's course as Vice-President had won the admiration
even of enemies,<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> his political fall was decreed
from the moment he cast his vote on the Judiciary
Bill in disregard of the rigid party discipline that
Jefferson and the Republican leaders then exacted.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>Even before this, the constantly increasing frigidity
of the President toward him, and the refusal of
the Administration to recognize by appointment any
one recommended by him for office in New York,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
had made it plain to all that the most Burr could
expect was Jefferson's passive hostility. Under these
circumstances, and soon after his judiciary vote, the
spirited Vice-President committed another impru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>dence.
He attended a banquet given by the Federalists
in honor of Washington's birthday. There
he proposed this impolitic toast: "To the union
of all honest men." Everybody considered this a
blow at Jefferson. It was even more offensive to the
Administration than his judiciary vote had been.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>From that moment all those peculiar weapons
which politicians so well know how to use for the
ruin of an opponent were employed for the destruction
of Aaron Burr. Moreover, Jefferson had decided
not only that Burr should not again be Vice-President,
but that his bitterest enemy from his own
State, George Clinton, should be the Republican candidate
for that office; and, in view of Burr's strength
and resourcefulness, this made necessary the latter's
political annihilation.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> "Never in the history of the
United States did so powerful a combination of rival
politicians unite to break down a single man as that
which arrayed itself against Burr."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Burr, who "was not a vindictive
man,"<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> did not retaliate for a long time.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> But at last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
to retrieve himself,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> he determined to appeal to the
people&mdash;at whose hands he had never suffered defeat&mdash;and,
in 1804, he became a candidate for the
office of Governor of New York. The New York
Federalists, now reduced to a little more than a
strong faction, wished to support him, and were
urged to do so by many Federalist leaders of other
States. Undoubtedly Burr would have been elected
but for the attacks of Hamilton.</p>

<p>At this period the idea of secession was stirring in
the minds of the New England Federalist leaders.
Such men as Timothy Pickering, Roger Griswold,
Uriah Tracy, and James Hillhouse had even avowed
separation from the Union to be desirable and certain;
and talk of it was general.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> All these men were
warm and insistent in their support of Burr for
Governor, and at least two of them, Pickering and
Griswold, had a conference with him in New York
while the campaign was in progress.</p>

<p>Plumer notes in his diary that during the winter
of 1804, at a dinner given in Washington attended
by himself, Pickering, Hillhouse, Burr, and other
public men, Hillhouse "unequivocally declared that
... the United States would soon form two distinct
and separate governments."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> More than nine
months before, certain of the most distinguished
New England Federalists had gone to the extreme
length of laying their object of national dismemberment
before the British Minister, Anthony Merry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and had asked and received his promise to aid them
in their project of secession.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>There was nothing new in the idea of dismembering
the Union. Indeed, no one subject was more
familiar to all parts of the country. Since before the
adoption of the Constitution, it had been rife in the
settlements west of the Alleghanies.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> The very year
the National Government was organized under the
Constitution, the settlers beyond the Alleghanies
were much inclined to withdraw from the Union because
the Mississippi River had not been secured to
them.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> For many years this disunion sentiment grew
in strength. When, however, the Louisiana Purchase
gave the pioneers on the Ohio and the Mississippi a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
free water-way to the Gulf and the markets of the
world, the Western secessionist tendency disappeared.
But after the happy accident that bestowed
upon us most of the great West as well as the mouth
of the Mississippi, there was in the Eastern States
a widely accepted opinion that this very fact made
necessary the partitioning of the Republic.</p>

<p>Even Jefferson, as late as 1803, did not think that
outcome unlikely, and he was prepared to accept it
with his blessing: "If they see their interest in separation,
why should we take sides with our Atlantic
rather than our Mississippi descendants? It is the
elder and the younger brother differing. God bless
them both, and keep them in union, if it be for their
good, but separate them, if it be better."<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>Neither Spain nor Great Britain had ever given
over the hope of dividing the young Republic and
of acquiring for themselves portions of its territory.
The Spanish especially had been active and unceasing
in their intrigues to this end, their efforts being
directed, of course, to the acquisition of the lands
adjacent to them and bordering on the Mississippi
and the Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> In this work more than one American
was in their pay. Chief of these Spanish agents was
James Wilkinson, who had been a pensioner of Spain
from 1787,<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> and so continued until at least 1807, the
bribe money coming into his hands for several years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
after he had been placed in command of the armies
of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>None of these plots influenced the pioneers to
wish to become Spanish subjects; the most that they
ever desired, even at the height of their dissatisfaction
with the American Government, was independence
from what they felt to be the domination
of the East. In 1796 this feeling reached its climax
in the Kentucky secession movement, one of its
most active leaders being Wilkinson, who declared
his purpose of becoming "the Washington of the
West."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>By 1805, however, the allegiance of the pioneers
to the Nation was as firm as that of any other part
of the Republic. They had become exasperated to
the point of violence against Spanish officials, Spanish
soldiers, and the Spanish Government. They
regarded the Spanish provinces of the Floridas and
of Mexico as mere satrapies of a hated foreign autocracy;
and this indeed was the case. Everywhere
west of the Alleghanies the feeling was universal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
that these lands on the south and southwest, held in
subjection by an ancient despotism, should be "revolutionized"
and "liberated"; and this feeling was
shared by great numbers of people of the Eastern
States.</p>

<p>Moreover, that spirit of expansion&mdash;of taking
and occupying the unused and misused lands upon
our borders&mdash;which has been so marked through
American history, was then burning fiercely in every
Western breast. The depredations of the Spaniards
had finally lashed almost to a frenzy the resentment
which had for years been increasing in the States
bordering upon the Mississippi. All were anxious
to descend with fire and sword upon the offending
Spaniards.</p>

<p>Indeed, all over the Nation the conviction was
strong that war with Spain was inevitable. Even
the ultra-pacific Jefferson was driven to this conclusion;
and, in less than ten months after Aaron
Burr ceased to be Vice-President, and while he was
making his first journey through the West and
Southwest, the President, in two Messages to Congress,
scathingly arraigned Spanish misdeeds and
all but avowed that a state of war actually existed.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>Such, in broad outline, was the general state of
things when Aaron Burr, his political and personal
fortunes wrecked, cast about for a place to go and for
work to do. He could not return to his practice in
New York; there his enemies were in absolute control
and he was under indictment for having chal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>lenged
Hamilton. The coroner's jury also returned
an inquest of murder against Burr and two of his
friends, and warrants for their arrest were issued. In
New Jersey, too, an indictment for murder hung
over him.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>Only in the fresh and undeveloped West did a new
life and a new career seem possible. Many projects
filled his mind&mdash;everything was possible in that inviting
region beyond the mountains. He thought of
forming a company to dig a canal around the falls
of the Ohio and to build a bridge over that river,
connecting Louisville with the Indiana shore. He
considered settling lands in the vast dominions beyond
the Mississippi which the Nation had newly
acquired from Spain. A return to public life as
Representative in Congress from Tennessee passed
through his mind.</p>

<p>But one plan in particular fitted the situation
which the apparently certain war with Spain created.
Nearly ten years earlier,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Hamilton had
conceived the idea of the conquest of the Spanish
possessions adjacent to us, and he had sought to
enlist the Government in support of the project of
Miranda to revolutionize Venezuela.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Aaron Burr
had proposed the invasion and capture of the
Floridas, Louisiana, and Mexico two years before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Hamilton embraced the project,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and the desire to
carry out the plan continued strong within him. Circumstances
seemed to make the accomplishment of
it feasible. At all events, a journey through the
West would enlighten him, as well as make clearer
the practicability of his other schemes.</p>

<p>Now occurred the most unfortunate and disgraceful
incident of Burr's life. In order to get money
for his Mexican adventure, Burr played upon the
British Minister's hostile feelings toward America
and, in doing so, used downright falsehood. Although
it was unknown at the time and not out of
keeping with the unwritten rules of the game called
diplomacy as then played, and although it had no
effect upon the thrilling events that brought Burr
before Marshall, so inextricably has this shameful
circumstance been woven into the story of the Burr
conspiracy, that mention of it must be made. It
was the first thoroughly dishonorable act of Burr's
tempestuous career.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Five months after Pickering, Griswold, and other
New England Federalists had approached Anthony
Merry with their plan to divide the Union, Burr
prepared to follow their example. He first sounded
that diplomat through a British officer, one Colonel
Charles Williamson. The object of the New England
Senators and Representatives had been to separate
their own and other Northern States from the Union;
the proposition that Williamson now made to the
British Minister was that Burr might do the same
thing for the Western States.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> It was well known
that the break-up of the Republic was expected and
hoped for by the British Government, as well as
by the Spaniards, and Williamson was not surprised
when he found Merry as favorably disposed toward
a scheme for separation of the States beyond the
Alleghanies as he had been hospitable to the plan
for the secession of New England.</p>

<p>Of the results of this conference Burr was advised;
and when he had finished his preparations for his
journey down the Ohio, he personally called upon
Merry. This time a part of his real purpose was
revealed; it was to secure funds.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Burr asked that
half a million dollars be supplied him<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> for the revolutionizing
of the Western States, but he did not
tell of his dream about Mexico, for the realization of
which the money was probably to be employed. In
short, Burr lied; and in order to persuade Merry to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
secure for him financial aid he proposed to commit
treason. Henry Adams declares that, so far as
the proposal of treason was concerned, there was
no difference between the moral delinquency of
Pickering, Griswold, Hillhouse, and other Federalists
and that of Aaron Burr.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>The eager and credulous British diplomat promised
to do his best and sent Colonel Williamson on a
special mission to London to induce Pitt's Ministry
to make the investment.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> It should be repeated that
Burr's consultations with the shallow and easily deceived
Merry were not known at the time. Indeed,
they never were fully revealed until more than three
quarters of a century afterward.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Moreover, it has
been demonstrated that they had little or no bearing
upon the adventure which Burr finally tried to
carry out.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> He was, as has been said, audaciously
and dishonestly playing upon Merry's well-known
hostility to this country in order to extract money
from the British Treasury.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> This attempt and the
later one upon the Spanish Minister, who was
equally antagonistic to the United States, were
revolting exhibitions of that base cunning and du<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>plicity
which, at that period, formed so large a part
of secret international intrigue.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="JAMES WILKINSON" title="" />
</div>

<p>On April 10, 1805, Burr left Philadelphia on horseback
for Pittsburgh, where he arrived after a nineteen
days' journey. Before starting he had talked
over his plans with several friends, among them
former Senator Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey,
who thereafter was a partner and fellow "conspirator."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>Another man with whom Burr had conferred was
General James Wilkinson. Burr expected to meet
him at Pittsburgh, but the General was delayed and
the meeting was deferred. Wilkinson had just been
appointed Governor of Upper Louisiana&mdash;one of
the favors granted Burr during the Chase impeachment&mdash;and
was the intimate associate of the fallen
politician in his Mexican plan until, in a welter of
falsehood and corruption, he betrayed him. Indeed,
it was Wilkinson who, during the winter of 1804-05,
when Burr was considering his future, proposed to
him the invasion of Mexico and thus gave new life
to Burr's old but never abandoned hope.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>On May 2, Burr started down the Ohio. When he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
reached Marietta, Ohio, he was heartily welcomed.
He next stopped at an island owned by Harman
Blennerhassett, who happened to be away. While
inspecting the grounds Burr was invited by Mrs.
Blennerhassett to remain for dinner. Thus did
chance lay the foundations for that acquaintance
which, later, led to a partnership in the enterprise
that was ended so disastrously for both.</p>

<p>At Cincinnati, then a town of some fifteen hundred
inhabitants, the attentions of the leading citizens
were markedly cordial. There Burr was the guest
of John Smith, then a Senator from Ohio, who had
become attached to Burr while the latter was Vice-President,
and who was now one of his associates in
the plans under consideration. At Smith's house he
met Dayton, and with these friends and partners
he held a long conversation on the various schemes
they were developing.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>A week later found him at the "unhealthy and inconsiderable
village"<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> of Louisville and from there
he traveled by horseback to Frankfort and Lexington.
While in Kentucky he conferred with General
John Adair, then a member of the National Senate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
who, like Smith and Dayton, had in Washington
formed a strong friendship for Burr, and was his
confidant.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Another eminent man with whom he
consulted was John Brown, then a member of the
United States Senate from Kentucky, also an admirer
of Burr.</p>

<p>It would appear that the wanderer was then seriously
considering the proposal, previously made by
Matthew Lyon, now a Representative in Congress
from Kentucky, that Burr should try to go to the
National House from Tennessee,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> for Burr asked and
received from Senator Brown letters to friends in
that State who could help to accomplish that design.
But not one word did Burr speak to General
Adair, to Senator Brown, or to any one else of his
purpose to dismember the Nation.</p>

<p>Burr arrived at Nashville at the end of the month.
The popular greeting had grown warmer with each
stage of his journey, and at the Tennessee Capital
it rose to noisy enthusiasm. Andrew Jackson, then
Major-General of the State Militia, was especially
fervent and entertained Burr at his great log house.
A "magnificent parade" was organized in his honor.
From miles around the pioneers thronged into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
frontier Capital. Flags waved, fifes shrilled, drums
rolled, cannon thundered. A great feast was spread
and Burr addressed the picturesque gathering.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>
Never in the brightest days of his political success
had he been so acclaimed. Jackson, nine years before,
when pleading with Congress to admit Tennessee
into the Union, had met and liked Burr, who
had then advocated statehood for that vigorous and
aggressive Southern Territory. Jackson's gratitude
for Burr's services to the State in championing its
admission,<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> together with his admiration for the
man, now ripened into an ardent friendship.</p>

<p>His support of Burr well reflected that of the
people among whom the latter now found himself.
Accounts of Burr's conduct as presiding officer at
the trial of Chase had crept through the wilderness;
the frontier newspapers were just printing Burr's
farewell speech to the Senate, and descriptions of
the effect of it upon the great men in Washington
were passing from tongue to tongue. All this gilded
the story of Burr's encounter with Hamilton, which,
from the beginning, had been applauded by the
people of the West and South.</p>

<p>Burr was now in a land of fighting men, where
dueling was considered a matter of honor rather than
disgrace. He was in a rugged democracy which regarded
as a badge of distinction, instead of shame,
the killing in fair fight of the man it had been taught
to believe to be democracy's greatest foe. Here, said
these sturdy frontiersmen, was the captain so long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
sought for, who could lead them in the winning of
Texas and Mexico for America; and this Burr now
declared himself ready to do&mdash;a purpose which
added the final influence toward the conquest of the
mind and heart of Andrew Jackson.</p>

<p>Floating down the Cumberland River in a boat
provided by Jackson, Burr encountered nothing but
friendliness and encouragement. At Fort Massac he
was the guest of Wilkinson, with whom he remained
for four days, talking over the Mexican project. Soon
afterward he was on his way down the Mississippi
from St. Louis in a larger boat with colored sails,
manned by six soldiers&mdash;all furnished by Wilkinson.
After Burr's departure Wilkinson wrote to
Adair, with whom he had served in the Indian
wars, that "we must have a peep at the unknown
world beyond me."</p>

<p>On June 25, 1805, Burr landed at New Orleans,
then the largest city west of the Alleghanies. There
the ovation to the "hero" surpassed even the demonstration
at Nashville. Again came dinners, balls,
f&ecirc;tes, and every form of public and private favor.
So perfervid was the welcome to him that the Sisters
of the largest nunnery in Louisiana invited Burr to
visit their convent, and this he did, under the conduct
of the bishop.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Wilkinson had given him a
letter of introduction to Daniel Clark, the leading
merchant of the city and the most influential man
in Louisiana. The letter contained this cryptic sentence:
"To him [Burr] I refer you for many things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
improper to letter, and which he will not say to any
other."<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>The notables of the city were eager to befriend
Burr and to enter into his plans. Among them were
John Watkins, Mayor of New Orleans, and James
Workman, Judge of the Court of Orleans County.
These men were also the leading members of the
Mexican Association, a body of three hundred
Americans devoted to effecting the "liberation" of
Mexico&mdash;a design in which they accurately expressed
the general sentiment of Louisiana. The
invasion of Mexico had become Burr's overmastering
purpose, and it gathered strength the farther he
journeyed among the people of the West and South.
To effect it, definite plans were now made.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>The Catholic authorities of New Orleans approved
Burr's project, and appointed three priests to act as
agents for the revolutionists in Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Burr's
vision of Spanish conquest seemed likely of realization.
The invasion of Mexico was in every heart,
on every tongue. All that was yet lacking to make
it certain was war between Spain and the United
States, and every Western or Southern man believed
that war was at hand.</p>

<p>Late in July, Burr, with justifiably high hope, left
New Orleans by the overland route for Nashville,
riding on horses supplied by Daniel Clark. Everywhere
he found the pioneers eager for hostilities. At
Natchez the people were demonstrative. By August
6, Burr was again with Andrew Jackson, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
ridden over Indian trails four hundred and fifty
miles through the swampy wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>The citizens of Nashville surpassed even their
first welcome. At the largest public dinner ever
given in the West up to that time, Burr entered the
hall on Jackson's arm and was received with cheers.
Men and women vied with one another in doing him
honor. The news Burr brought from New Orleans of
the headway that was being made regarding the projected
descent upon the Spanish possessions, thrilled
Jackson; and his devotion to the man whom all
Westerners and Southerners had now come to look
upon as their leader knew no bounds.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> For days
Jackson and Burr talked of the war with Spain which
the bellicose Tennessee militia general passionately
desired, and of the invasion of Mexico which Burr
would lead when hostilities began.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> At Lexington,
at Frankfort, everywhere, Burr was received in similar
fashion. While in Kentucky he met Henry Clay,
who at once yielded to his fascination.</p>

<p>But soon strange, dark rumors, starting from
Natchez, were sent flying over the route Burr had
just traveled with such acclaim. They were set on
foot by an American, one Stephen Minor, who was a
paid spy of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Burr, it was said, was about to
raise the standard of revolution in the Western and
Southern States. Daniel Clark wished to advise
Burr of these reports and of the origin of them, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
did not know where to reach him. So he hastened
to write Wilkinson that Burr might be informed
of the Spanish canard: "Kentucky, Tennessee, the
State of Ohio, ... with part of Georgia and Carolina,
are to be bribed with the plunder of the Spanish
countries west of us, to separate from the Union."
And Clark added: "Amuse Mr. Burr with an account
of it."<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson himself had long contemplated the idea
of dismembering the Nation; he had even sounded
some of his officers upon that subject.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> As we have
seen, he had been the leader of the secession movement
in Kentucky in 1796. But if Burr ever really
considered, as a practical matter, the separation of
the Western country from the Union, his intimate contact
with the people of that region had driven such a
scheme from his mind and had renewed and strengthened
his long-cherished wish to invade Mexico. For
throughout his travels he had heard loud demands
for the expulsion of Spanish rule from America; but
never, except perhaps at New Orleans, a hint of secession.
And if, during his journey, Burr so much as
intimated to anybody the dismemberment of the Republic,
no evidence of it ever has been produced.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>Ignorant of the sinister reports now on their way
behind him, Burr reached the little frontier town of
St. Louis early in September and again conferred
with Wilkinson, assuring him that the whole South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and West were impatient to attack the Spaniards,
and that in a short time an army could be raised to
invade Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> According to the story which the
General told nearly two years afterward, Burr informed
him that the South and West were ripe for
secession, and that Wilkinson responded that Burr
was sadly mistaken because "the Western people ...
are bigoted to Jefferson and democracy."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>Whatever the truth of this may be, it is certain
that the rumors put forth by his fellow Spanish
agent had shaken Wilkinson's nerve for proceeding
further with the enterprise which he himself had
suggested to Burr. Also, as we shall see, the avaricious
General had begun to doubt the financial wisdom
of giving up his profitable connection with the
Spanish Government. At all events, he there and
then began to lay plans to desert his associate. Accordingly,
he gave Burr a letter of introduction to
William Henry Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory,
in which he urged Harrison to have Burr sent
to Congress from Indiana, since upon this "perhaps
... the Union may much depend."<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>Mythical accounts of Burr's doings and intentions
had now sprung up in the East. The universally
known wish of New England Federalist leaders for a
division of the country, the common talk east of the
Alleghanies that this was inevitable, the vivid memory
of a like sentiment formerly prevailing in Kentucky,
and the belief in the seaboard States that it
still continued&mdash;all rendered probable, to those, liv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>ing
in that section, the schemes now attributed to
Burr.</p>

<p>Of these tales the Eastern newspapers made sensations.
A separate government, they said, was to
be set up by Burr in the Western States; the public
lands were to be taken over and divided among
Burr's followers; bounties, in the form of broad acres,
were to be offered as inducements for young men to
leave the Atlantic section of the country for the land
of promise toward the sunset; Burr's new government
was to repudiate its share of the public debt;
with the aid of British ships and gold Burr was
to conquer Mexico and establish a vast empire by
uniting that imperial domain to the revolutionized
Western and Southern States.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> The Western press
truthfully denied that any secession sentiment now
existed among the pioneers.</p>

<p>The rumors from the South and West met those
from the North and East midway; but Burr having
departed for Washington, they subsided for the time
being. The brushwood, however, had been gathered&mdash;to
burst into a raging conflagration a year later,
when lighted by the torch of Executive authority
in the hands of Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>During these months the Spanish officials in
Mexico and in the Floridas, who had long known
of the hostility of American feeling toward them,
learned of Burr's plan to seize the Spanish possessions,
and magnified the accounts they received of
the preparations he was making.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>The British Minister in Washington was also in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
spasms of nervous anxiety.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> When Burr reached
the Capital he at once called on that slow-witted
diplomat and repeated his overtures. But Pitt had
died; the prospect of British financial assistance had
ended;<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> and Burr sent Dayton to the Spanish Minister
with a weird tale<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> in order to induce that diplomat
to furnish money.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time the South American
adventurer, Miranda, again arrived in America, his
zeal more fiery than ever, for the "liberation" of
Venezuela. He was welcomed by the Administration,
and Secretary of State Madison gave him a
dinner. Jefferson himself invited the revolutionist
to dine at the Executive Mansion. Burr's hopes
were strengthened, since he intended doing in
Mexico precisely what Miranda was setting out to
do in Venezuela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>In February, 1806, Miranda sailed from New
York upon his Venezuelan undertaking. His openly
avowed purpose of forcibly expelling the Spanish
Government from that country had been explained
to Jefferson and Madison by the revolutionist personally.
Before his departure, the Spanish filibuster
wrote to Madison, cautioning him to keep "in the
deepest secret" the "important matters" which he
(Miranda) had laid before him.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> The object of his
expedition was a matter of public notoriety. In New
York, in the full light of day, he had bought arms and
provisions and had enlisted men for his enterprise.</p>

<p>Excepting for Burr's failure to secure funds from
the British Government, events seemed propitious
for the execution of his grand design. He had written
to Blennerhassett a polite and suggestive letter, not
inviting him, however, to engage in the adventure;<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
the eager Irishman promptly responded, begging to
be admitted as a partner in Burr's enterprises, and
pledging the services of himself and his friends.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
Burr, to his surprise, was cordially received by Jefferson
at the White House where he had a private conference
of two hours with the President.</p>

<p>The West openly demanded war with Spain; the
whole country was aroused; in the House, Randolph
offered a resolution to declare hostilities; everywhere
the President was denounced for weakness and delay.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>
If only Jefferson would act&mdash;if only the people's
earnest desire for war with Spain were granted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>&mdash;Burr
could go forward. But the President would
make no hostile move&mdash;instead, he proposed to buy
the Floridas. Burr, lacking funds, thought for a moment
of abandoning his plans against Mexico, and
actually asked Jefferson for a diplomatic appointment,
which was, of course, refused.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>The rumor had reached Spain that the Americans
had actually begun war. On the other hand, the
report now came to Washington that the Spaniards
had invaded American soil. The Secretary of War
ordered General Wilkinson to drive the Spaniards
back. The demand for war throughout the country
grew louder. If ever Burr's plan of Mexican conquest
was to be carried out, the moment had come
to strike the blow. His confederate, Wilkinson, in
command of the American Army and in direct contact
with the Spaniards, had only to act.</p>

<p>The swirl of intrigue continued. Burr tried to get
the support of men disaffected toward the Administration.
Among them were Commodore Truxtun,
Commodore Stephen Decatur, and "General"<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
William Eaton. Truxtun and Decatur were writhing
under that shameful treatment by which each of
these heroes had been separated, in effect removed,
from the Navy. Eaton was cursing the Administration
for deserting him in his African exploits, and
even more for refusing to pay several thousand
dollars which he claimed to have expended in his
Barbary transactions.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Truxtun and Burr were intimate friends, and the
Commodore was fully told of the design to invade
Mexico in the event of war with Spain; should that
not come to pass, Burr advised Truxtun that he
meant to settle lands he had arranged to purchase
beyond the Mississippi. He tried to induce Truxtun
to join him, suggesting that he would be put in
command of a naval force to capture Havana, Vera
Cruz, and Cartagena. When Burr "positively" informed
him that the President was not a party to
his enterprise, Truxtun declined to associate himself
with it. Not an intimation did Burr give Truxtun of
any purpose hostile to the United States. The two
agreed in their contemptuous opinion of Jefferson
and his Administration.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> To Commodore Decatur,
Burr talked in similar fashion, using substantially
the same language.</p>

<p>But to "General" Eaton, whom he had never be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>fore
met, Burr unfolded plans more far-reaching and
bloody, according to the Barbary hero's account of
the revelations.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> At first Burr had made to Eaton
the same statements he had detailed to Truxtun
and Decatur, with the notable difference that he
had assured Eaton that the proposed expedition was
"under the authority of the general government."
Notwithstanding his familiarity with intrigue, the
suddenly guileless Eaton agreed to lead a division
of the invading army under Wilkinson who, Burr
assured him, would be "Chief in Command."</p>

<p>But after a while Eaton's sleeping perception was
aroused. Becoming as sly as a detective, he resolved
to "draw Burr out," and "listened with seeming
acquiescence" while the villain "unveiled himself"
by confidences which grew ever wilder and more irrational:
Burr would establish an empire in Mexico
and divide the Union; he even "meditated overthrowing
the present Government"&mdash;if he could secure
Truxtun, Decatur, and others, he "<i>would turn
Congress neck and heels out of doors, assassinate the
President, seize the treasury and Navy; and declare
himself the protector of an energetic government</i>."</p>

<p>Eaton at last was "shocked" and "dropped the
mask," declaring that the one word, "<i>Usurper</i>,
would destroy" Burr. Thereupon Eaton went to
Jefferson and urged the President to appoint Burr
American Minister to some European government
and thus get him out of the country, declaring that
"<i>if Burr were not in some way disposed of we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
within eighteen months have an insurrection if not a
revolution on the waters of the Mississippi</i>." The
President was not perturbed&mdash;he had too much
confidence in the Western people, he said, "to admit
an <i>apprehension</i> of that kind." But of the horrid
details of the murderous and treasonable villain's
plans, never a word said Eaton to Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>However, the African hero did "detail the whole
projects of Mr. Burr" to certain members of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>
"They believed Col. Burr capable of anything&mdash;and
agreed that <i>the fellow ought to be
hanged</i>"; but they refused to be alarmed&mdash;Burr's
schemes were "too chimerical and his circumstances
too desperate to ... merit of serious consideration."<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
So for twelve long months Eaton said nothing more
about Burr's proposed deviltry. During this time
he continued alternately to belabor Congress and the
Administration for the payment of the expenses of
his Barbary exploits.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>Andrew Jackson, while entertaining Burr on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
first Western journey, had become the most promising,
in practical support, of all who avowed themselves
ready to follow Burr's invading standard into
Mexico; and with Jackson he had freely consulted
about that adventure. From Washington, Burr
now wrote the Tennessee leader of the beclouding
of their mutually cherished prospects of war with
Spain.</p>

<p>But hope of war was not dead, wrote Burr&mdash;indeed,
Miranda's armed expedition "composed of
American citizens, and openly fitted out in an American
port," made it probable. Jackson ought to be
attending to something more than his militia offices,
Burr admonished him: "Your country is full of fine
materials for an army, and I have often said a brigade
could be raised in West Tennessee which would
drive double their number of Frenchmen off the
earth." From such men let Jackson make out and
send to Burr "a list of officers from colonel down to
ensign for one or two regiments, composed of fellows
fit for business, and with whom you would trust your
life and your honor." Burr himself would, "in case
troops should be called for, recommend it to the
Department of War"; he had "reason to believe that
on such an occasion" that department would listen
to his advice.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Burr, oblivious to the danger that Eaton
might disclose the deadly secrets which he had so
imprudently confided to a dissipated stranger, resolved
to act and set out on his fateful journey. Before
doing so, he sent two copies of a cipher letter to
Wilkinson. This was in answer to a letter which Burr
had just received from Wilkinson, dated May 13,
1806, the contents of which never have been revealed.
Burr chose, as the messenger to carry overland one of
the copies, Samuel Swartwout, a youth then twenty-two
years of age, and brother of Colonel John Swartwout
whom Jefferson had removed from the office
of United States Marshal for the District of New
York largely because of the Colonel's lifelong friendship
for Burr. The other copy was sent by sea to
New Orleans by Dr. Justus Erich Bollmann.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>No thought had Burr that Wilkinson, his ancient
army friend and the arch conspirator of the whole
plot, would reveal his dispatch. He and Wilkinson
were united too deeply in the adventure for that to
be thinkable. Moreover, the imminence of war appeared
to make it certain that when the General
received Burr's cipher, the two men would be comrades
in arms against Spain in a war which, it cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
be too often repeated, it was believed Wilkinson
could bring on at any moment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Burr and Dayton had misgivings
that the timorous General might not attack the
Spaniards. They bolstered him up by hopeful letters,
appealing to his cupidity, his ambition, his vanity,
his fear. Dayton wrote that Jefferson was about
to displace him and appoint another head of the
army; let Wilkinson, therefore, precipitate hostilities&mdash;"You
know the rest.... Are you ready? Are
your numerous associates ready? Wealth and glory!
Louisiana and Mexico!"<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>In his cipher dispatch to Wilkinson, Burr went to
even greater lengths and with reason, for the impatient
General had written him another letter, urging
him to hurry: "I fancy Miranda has taken the
bread out of your mouth; and I shall be ready for
the grand expedition before you are."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Burr then
assured Wilkinson that he was not only ready but on
his way, and tried to strengthen the resolution of the
shifty General by falsehood. He told of tremendous
aid secured in far-off Washington and New York,
and intimated that England would help. He was
coming himself with money and men, and details
were given. Bombastic sentences&mdash;entirely unlike
any language appearing in Burr's voluminous correspondence
and papers&mdash;were well chosen for their
effect on Wilkinson's vainglorious mind: "The gods
invite us to glory and fortune; it remains to be seen
whether we deserve the boon.... Burr guarantees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the result with his life and honor, with the lives and
honor and the fortunes of hundreds, the best blood
of our country."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>Fatal error! The sending of that dispatch was to
give Wilkinson his opportunity to save himself by
assuming the disguise of patriotism and of fealty
to Jefferson, and, clad in these habiliments, to denounce
his associates in the Mexican adventure as
traitors to America. Soon, very soon, Wilkinson was
to use Burr's letter in a fashion to bring his friend
and many honest men to the very edge of execution&mdash;a
fate from which only the fearlessness and penetrating
mind of John Marshall was to save them.</p>

<p>But this black future Burr could not foresee. Certain,
as were most men, that war with Spain could
not be delayed much longer, and knowing that Wilkinson
could precipitate it at any moment, Burr's
mind was at rest. At the beginning of August, 1806,
he once more journeyed down the Ohio. On the way
he stopped at a settlement on the Monongahela, not
far from Pittsburgh, where he visited one Colonel
George Morgan. This man afterward declared that
Burr talked mysteriously&mdash;the Administration was
contemptible, two hundred men could drive the
Government into the Potomac, five hundred could
take New York; and, Burr added laughingly,
even the Western States could be detached from the
Union. Most of this was said "in the presence of a
considerable company."<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder Morgan, who was aged and garrulous,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
pieced together his inferences from Burr's meaning
looks, jocular innuendoes, and mysterious statements,<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>
and detected a purpose to divide the Nation.
Deeply moved, he laid his deductions before the
Chief Justice of Pennsylvania and two other gentlemen
from Pittsburgh, a town close at hand; and a
letter was written to Jefferson, advising him of the
threatened danger.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>From Pittsburgh, Burr for the second time landed
on the island of Harman Blennerhassett, who was
eager for any adventure that would restore his declining
fortunes. If war with Spain should, after all,
not come to pass, Burr's other plan was the purchase
of the enormous Bastrop land grant on the Washita
River. Blennerhassett avidly seized upon both
projects.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> From that moment forward, the settlement
of this rich and extensive domain in the then
untouched and almost unexplored West became
the alternative purpose of Aaron Burr in case the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
desire of his heart, the seizure of Mexico, should
fail.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately Blennerhassett who, as his friends
declared, "had all kinds of sense, except common
sense,"<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> now wrote a series of letters for an Ohio
country newspaper in answer to the articles appearing
in the Kentucky organ of Daveiss and Humphrey
Marshall, the <i>Western World</i>. The Irish enthusiast
tried to show that a separation of the Western States
from "Eastern domination" would be a good thing.
These foolish communications were merely repetitions
of similar articles then appearing in the Federalist
press of New England, and of effusions printed
in Southern newspapers a few years before. Nobody,
it seems, paid much attention to these vagaries
of Blennerhassett. It is possible that Burr knew
of them, but proof of this was never adduced. When
the explosion came, however, Blennerhassett's maunderings
were recalled, and they became another one
of those evidences of Burr's guilt which, to the public
mind, were "confirmation strong as proofs of holy
writ."</p>

<p>Burr and his newly made partner contracted for
the building of fifteen boats, to be delivered in four
months; and pork, meal, and other provisions were
purchased. The island became the center of operations.
Soon a few young men from Pittsburgh
joined the enterprise, some of them sons of Revolutionary
officers, and all of them of undoubted loyalty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
to the Nation. To each of these one hundred acres
of land on the Washita were promised, as part of
their compensation for participating in the expedition,
the entire purpose of which was not then explained
to them.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>Burr again visited Marietta, where the local
militia were assembled for their annual drill, and
put these rural soldiers through their evolutions,
again fascinating the whole community.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> At Cincinnati,
Burr held another long conference with his
partner, Senator John Smith, who was a contractor
and general storekeeper. The place which the
Washita land speculation had already come to hold
in his mind is shown by the conversation&mdash;Burr
talked as much of that project as he did of war with
Spain and his great ambition to invade Mexico;<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
but of secession, not a syllable.</p>

<p>Next Burr hurried to Nashville and once more
became the honored guest of Andrew Jackson, whom
he frankly told of the modification of his plans. His
immediate purpose, Burr said, now was to settle the
Washita lands. Of course, if war should break out
he would lead a force into Texas and Mexico. Burr
kept back only the part Wilkinson was to play in
precipitating hostilities; and he said nothing of his
efforts to bolster up that frail warrior's resolution.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>In Tennessee and Kentucky the talk was again of
war with Spain. Indeed, it was now the only talk.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
For the third time in the Tennessee Capital a public
banquet was given to the hero by whom the people
expected to be led against the enemy. Soon afterward
Jackson issued his proclamation to the Tennessee
militia calling them to arms against the hated
Spaniards, and volunteered his services to the National
Government. Jefferson answered in a letter
provoking in its vagueness.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>At Lexington, Kentucky, Burr and Blennerhassett
now purchased from Colonel Charles Lynch,
the owner of the Bastrop grant, several hundred
thousand acres on the Washita River in Northern
Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>To many to whom Burr had spoken of his scheme
to invade Mexico he gave the impression that his
designs had the approval of the Administration; to
some he actually stated this to be the fact. In case
war was declared, the Administration, of course,
would necessarily support Burr's attack upon the
enemy; if hostilities did not occur, the "Government
might overlook the preparations as in the case
of Miranda."<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> It is hard to determine whether the
project to invade Mexico&mdash;of which Burr did not
inform them, but which they knew to be his purpose&mdash;or
the plan to settle the Washita lands, was
the more attractive to the young men who wished
to join him. Certainly, the Bastrop grant was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
placed as to afford every possible lure to the youthful,
enterprising, and adventurous.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p>At this moment Wilkinson, apparently recovered
from the panic into which Clark's letter had thrown
him a year before, seemed resolved at last to strike.
He even wrote with enthusiasm to General John
Adair: "The time long looked for by many &amp;
wished for by more has now arrived, for subverting
the Spanish government in Mexico&mdash;be ready &amp;
join me; we will want little more than light armed
troops.... More will be done by marching than by
fighting.... We cannot fail of success.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Your military
talents are requisite. Unless you fear to join a
Spanish intriguer [Wilkinson] come immediately&mdash;without
your aid I can do nothing."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> In reply Adair
wrote Wilkinson that "the United States had not declared
war against Spain and he did not believe they
would." If not, Adair would not violate the law by
joining Wilkinson's projected attack on Spain.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>By the same post Wilkinson wrote to Senator John
Smith a letter bristling with italics: "I shall assuredly
push them [the Spaniards] over the Sabine ... as that
you are alive.... <i>You must speedily send me a force</i> to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
support our pretensions ... <i>5000 mounted infantry ...
may suffice to carry us forward as far as Grand River</i>
[the Rio Grande], <i>there we shall require 5000 more to
conduct us to Mount el Rey ... after which from 20</i> to
<i>30,000 will be necessary to carry our conquests to California</i>
and the <i>Isthmus of Darien. I write in haste,
freely</i> and <i>confidentially</i>, being ever your friend."<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>In Kentucky once more the rumors sprang up
that Burr meant to dismember the Union, and these
were now put forward as definite charges. For
months Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, a brother-in-law
of John Marshall&mdash;appointed at the latter's instance
by President Adams as United States Attorney
for the District of Kentucky<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>&mdash;had been
writing Jefferson exciting letters about some kind of
conspiracy in which he was sure Burr was engaged.
The President considered lightly these tales written
him by one of his bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>With the idea of embarrassing the Republican
President, by connecting him, through the Administration's
seeming acquiescence in Burr's projects
as in the case of the Miranda expedition, Daveiss
and his relative, former Senator Humphrey Marshall&mdash;both
leaders of the few Federalists now remaining
in Kentucky&mdash;welded together the rumors
of Burr's Mexican designs and those of his treasonable
plot to separate the Western States from the
Union. These they published in a newspaper which
they controlled at Frankfort.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>The moss was removed from the ancient Spanish
intrigues; Wilkinson was truthfully denounced as a
pensioner of Spain; but the plot, it was charged, had
veered from a union of the West with the Spanish
dominions, to the establishment, by force of arms,
of an independent trans-Alleghany Government.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
The Federalist organs in the East adopted the stories
related in the <i>Western World</i>, and laid especial emphasis
on the disloyalty of the Western States,
particularly of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The rumors had so aroused the people living near
Blennerhassett's island that Mrs. Blennerhassett
sent a messenger to warn Burr that he could not, in
safety, appear there again. Learning this from the
bearer of these tidings, Burr's partner, Senator John
Smith, demanded of his associate an explanation.
Burr promptly answered that he was "greatly surprised
and really hurt" by Smith's letter. "If," said
Burr, "there exists any design to separate the Western
from the Eastern States, I am totally ignorant of
it. I never harbored or expressed any such intention
to any one, nor did any person ever intimate such
design to me."<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Daveiss and Humphrey Marshall now resolved to
stay the progress of the plot at which they were
convinced that the Republican Administration was
winking. If Jefferson was complacent, Daveiss would
act and act officially; thus the President, by contrast,
would be fatally embarrassed. Another motive, personal
in its nature, inspired Daveiss. He was an
able, fearless, passionate man, and he hated Burr
violently for having killed Hamilton whom Daveiss
had all but worshiped.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<p>Early in November the District Attorney moved
the United States Court at Frankfort to issue compulsory
process for Burr's apprehension and for
the attendance of witnesses. Burr heard of this at
Lexington and sent word that he would appear voluntarily.
This he did, and, the court having denied
Daveiss's motion because of the irregularity of it,
the accused demanded that a public and official
investigation be made of his plans and activities.
Accordingly, the grand jury was summoned and
Daveiss given time to secure witnesses.</p>

<p>On the day appointed Burr was in court. By his
side was his attorney, a tall, slender, sandy-haired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
young man of twenty-nine who had just been appointed
to the National Senate. Thus Henry Clay
entered the drama. Daveiss failed to produce a
single witness, and Burr, "after a dignified and grave
harangue," was discharged, to the tumultuous delight
of the people.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>Two weeks later the discomfited but persistent
and undaunted District Attorney again demanded of
Judge Innes the apprehension of the "traitor." Clay
requested of Burr a written denial of the charges so
incessantly made against him. This Burr promptly
furnished.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Clay was so convinced of Burr's integrity
that he declared in court that he "could pledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
his own honor and innocence" for those of his client.
Once more no witnesses were produced; once more
the grand jury could not return an indictment; once
more Burr was discharged. The crowd that packed
the court-room burst into cheers.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> That night a ball,
given in Burr's honor, crowned this second of his
triumphs in the United States Court.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p>

<p>Thereafter Burr continued his preparations as if
nothing had happened. To all he calmly stated the
propriety of his enterprise. To his fellow adventurer,
Senator John Smith, he was again particularly explicit
and clear: "If there should be a war between
the United States and Spain, I shall head a corps of
volunteers and be the first to march into the Mexican
provinces. If peace should be proffered, which I do
not expect, I shall settle my Washita lands, and
make society as pleasant as possible.... I have been
persecuted, shamefully persecuted."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> As to dividing
the Union, Burr told Smith that "if Bonaparte with
all his army were in the western country with the
object ... he would never see salt water again."<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>While Burr was writing this letter, Jefferson was
signing a document that, when sent forth, as it immediately
was, ignited all the rumors, reports, accusations,
and suspicions that had been accumulating,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
and set the country on fire with wrath against the
disturber of our national bliss.</p>

<p>When Wilkinson received Burr's cipher dispatch,
he took time to consider the best methods for saving
himself, filling his purse, and brightening his tarnished
reputation.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> The faithful and unsuspecting
young Swartwout, Burr's messenger, was persuaded
to remain in Wilkinson's camp for a week after the
delivery of the fatal letter. He was treated with
marked friendliness, and from him the General
afterward pretended to have extracted frightful
details of Burr's undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Seven more days passed, and at last, two weeks
after he had received Burr's cipher dispatch, Wilkinson
wrote Jefferson that "a Numerous and powerful
Association, extending from New York to ...
the Mississippi had been formed to levy &amp; rendezvous
eight or Ten Thousand Men in New Orleans ...
&amp; from thence ... to carry an Expedition against
Vera Cruz." Wilkinson gave details&mdash;dates and
places of assembling troops, methods of invasion,
etc., and added: "It is unknown under what Authority
this Enterprize has been projected, from where
the means of its support are derived, or what may
be the intentions of its leaders in relation to the
Territory of Orleans."<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>Surprising as this was, the General supported it
by a "confidential" and personal letter to Jefferson<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>
still more mysterious and disquieting: "The mag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>nitude
of the Enterprize, the desperation of the
Place, and the stupendous consequences with which
it seems pregnant, stagger my belief &amp; excite doubts
of the reality, against the conviction of my Senses;
&amp; it is for this reason I shall forbear to commit Names....
I have never in my whole Life found myself in
such circumstances of perplexity and Embarrassment
as at present; for I am not only uninformed of
the prime mover and Ultimate Objects of this daring
Enterprize, but am ignorant of the foundation
on which it rests."</p>

<p>Wilkinson went on to say that, as an inducement
for him to take part in it, he had been told that "you
[Jefferson] connive at the combination and that our
country will justify it." If this were not true, "then
I have no doubt the revolt of this Territory will be
made an auxiliary step to the main design of attacking
Mexico." So he thought he ought to compromise
with the Spaniards and throw himself with his "little
Band into New Orleans, to be ready to defend that
Capitol against Usurpation and violence."</p>

<p>He wrote more to the same effect, and added this
postscript: "Should Spain be disposed to War seriously
with us, might not some plan be adopted to
correct the delirium of the associates, and by a pitiable
appeal to their patriotism to engage them in the
service of their Country. I merely offer the suggestion
as a possible expedient to prevent the Horrors
of a civil contest, and I do believe that, with competent
authority I could accomplish the object."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the letter which a few months later
caused Chief Justice John Marshall to issue a subp&#339;na
<i>duces tecum</i> directed to President Thomas
Jefferson in order to have it produced in court.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson had known of the rumors about Burr&mdash;George
Morgan, Joseph H. Daveiss, and William
Eaton had put him on the track of the "traitor."
Others had told of the American Catiline's treasonable
plans; and the newspapers, of which he
was a studious reader, had advised the President
of every sensation that had appeared. Jefferson and
his Cabinet had nervously debated the situation, decided
on plans to forestall the conspiracy, and then
hurriedly abandoned them;<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> evidently they had no
faith in the lurid stories of Burr's treasonable purposes
and preparations.</p>

<p>Letters to Jefferson from the West, arriving October
24, 1806, bore out the disbelief of the President
and his Cabinet in Burr's lawless activities; for
these advices from the President's friends who, on
the ground, were closely watching Burr, contained
"not one word ... of any movements by Colonel
Burr. This total silence of the officers of the Government,
of the members of Congress, of the newspapers,
proves he is committing no overt act against
law," Jefferson wrote in his Cabinet Memorandum.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>
So the President and his Cabinet decided to do
nothing further at that time than to order John
Graham, while on his way to assume the office of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Secretary of the Orleans Territory, to investigate
Burr's activities.</p>

<p>But when the mysterious warnings from Wilkinson
reached Jefferson, he again called his Cabinet into
consultation and precipitate action was taken. Orders
were dispatched to military commanders to take
measures against Burr's expedition; Wilkinson was
directed to withdraw his troops confronting the
Spaniards and dispose of them for the defense of
New Orleans and other endangered points.</p>

<p>Most important of all, a Presidential Proclamation
was issued to all officials and citizens, declaring
that a conspiracy had been discovered, warning all
persons engaged in it to withdraw, and directing the
ferreting out and seizure of the conspirators' "vessels,
arms and military stores."<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> Graham preceded
the Proclamation and induced Governor Tiffin and
the Ohio Legislature to take action for the seizure of
Burr's boats and supplies at Marietta; and this was
done.</p>

<p>On December 10, 1806, Comfort Tyler of Onondaga
County, New York, one of the minor leaders of
the Burr expedition,<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> arrived at Blennerhassett's
island with a few boats and some twenty young men
who had joined the adventure. There were a half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>-dozen
rifles among them, and a few fowling pieces.
With these the youths went hunting in the Ohio
forests. Blennerhassett, too, had his pistols. This
was the whole of the warlike equipment of that militant
throng&mdash;all that constituted that "overt act
of treason by levying war against the United States"
which soon brought Burr within the shadow of the
gallows.</p>

<p>Jefferson's Proclamation had now reached Western
Virginia, and it so kindled the patriotism of the
militia of Wood County, within the boundaries of
which the island lay, that that heroic host resolved
to descend in its armed might upon the embattled
"traitors," capture and deliver them to the vengeance
of the law. The Wood County men, unlike
those of Ohio, needed no act of legislature to set
their loyalty in motion. The Presidential Proclamation,
and the sight of the enemies of the Nation gathered
in such threatening and formidable array on
Blennerhassett's island, were more than enough to
cause them to spring to arms in behalf of their imperiled
country.</p>

<p>Badly frightened, Blennerhassett and Tyler, leaving
Mrs. Blennerhassett behind, fled down the river
with thirty men in six half-equipped boats. They
passed the sentries of the Wood County militia only
because those ministers of vigilance had got thoroughly
drunk and were sound asleep. Next day,
however, the militia invaded the deserted island
and, finding the generously stocked wine cellar, restored
their strength by drinking all the wine and
whiskey on the place. They then demonstrated their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
abhorrence of treason by breaking the windows,
demolishing the furniture, tearing the pictures,
trampling the flower-beds, burning the fences, and
insulting Mrs. Blennerhassett.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>Graham procured the authorities of Kentucky to
take action similar to that adopted in Ohio. Burr,
still ignorant of Jefferson's Proclamation, proceeded
to Nashville, there to embark in the boats Jackson
was building for him, to go on the last river voyage
of his adventure.</p>

<p>Jackson, like Smith and Clay, had been made uneasy
by the rumors of Burr's treasonable designs. He
had written Governor Claiborne at New Orleans a
letter of warning, particularly against Wilkinson, and
not mentioning Burr by name.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> When Burr arrived
at the Tennessee Capital, Jackson, his manner now
cold, demanded an explanation. Burr, "with his
usual dignified courtesy, instantly complied."<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> It
would seem that Jackson was satisfied by his reassurance,
in spite of the President's Proclamation
which reached Nashville three days before Burr's
departure;<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> for not only did Jackson permit him
to proceed, but, when the adventurer started down
the Cumberland in two of the six boats which he
had built on Burr's previous orders, consented that
a nephew of his wife should make one of the ten
or fifteen young men who accompanied the expedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>tion.
He even gave the boy a letter of introduction
to Governor Claiborne at New Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<p>After the people had recovered from the shock of
astonishment that Jefferson's Proclamation gave
them, the change in them was instantaneous and
extreme.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> The President, to be sure, had not mentioned
Burr's name or so much as hinted at treason;
all that Jefferson charged was a conspiracy to attack
the hated Spaniards, and this was the hope and
desire of every Westerner. Nevertheless, the public
intelligence penetrated what it believed to be the
terrible meaning behind the President's cautious
words; the atrocious purpose to dismember the
Union, reports of which had pursued Burr since a
Spanish agent had first set the rumor afoot a year
before, was established in the minds of the people.</p>

<p>Surely the President would not hunt down an
American seeking to overthrow Spanish power in
North America, when a Spanish "liberator" had
been permitted to fit out in the United States an
expedition to do the same thing in South America.
Surely Jefferson would not visit his wrath on one
whose only crime was the gathering of men to strike
at Spain with which power, up to that very moment,
everybody supposed war to be impending and, indeed,
almost begun. This was unthinkable. Burr
must be guilty of a greater crime&mdash;the greatest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
crimes. In such fashion was public opinion made
ready to demand the execution of the "traitor" who
had so outrageously deceived the people; and that
popular outcry began for the blood of Aaron Burr
by which John Marshall was assailed while presiding
over the court to which the accused was finally
taken.</p>

<p>From the moment that Wilkinson decided to denounce
Burr to the President, his language became
that of a Bombastes Furioso, his actions those of a
military ruffian, his secret movements matched the
cunning of a bribe-taking criminal. By swiftest dispatch
another message was sent to Jefferson. "My
doubts have ceased," wrote Wilkinson, concerning
"this deep, dark, wicked, and wide-spread conspiracy,
embracing the young and the old, the democrat and
the federalist, the native and the foreigner, the patriot
of '76 and the exotic of yesterday, the opulent
and the needy, the ins and the outs."</p>

<p>Wilkinson assured Jefferson, however, that he
would meet the awful emergency with "indefatigable
industry, incessant vigilance and hardy courage";
indeed, declared he, "I shall glory to give my life"
to defeat the devilish plot. But the numbers of the
desperadoes were so great that, unless Jefferson
heavily reinforced him with men and ships, he and
the American army under his command would probably
perish.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>As the horse bearing the messenger to Jefferson
disappeared in the forests, another, upon which rode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
a very different agent, left Wilkinson's camp and
galloped toward the Southwest. The latter agent
was Walter Burling, a corrupt factotum of Wilkinson's,
whom that martial patriot sent to the Spanish
Viceroy at Mexico City to advise him of Wilkinson's
latest service to Spain in thwarting Burr's attack
upon the royal possessions, and in averting war between
the United States and His Catholic Majesty.
For these noble performances Wilkinson demanded
of the Spanish Viceroy more than one hundred and
ten thousand dollars in cash, together with other
sums which "he [had] been obliged to spend in order
to sustain the cause of good government, order and
humanity."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson had asked the Viceroy to destroy the
letter and this was accordingly done in Burling's
presence. The Royal representative then told Burling
that he knew all about Burr's plans to invade
Mexico, and had long been ready to repel a much
larger force than Wilkinson stated Burr to be leading.
"I thanked him for his martial zeal and insinuated
that I wished him happiness in the pursuit of
his righteous intentions," wrote the disgusted and
sarcastic Viceroy in his report to the Government at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> With this Wilkinson had to be content, for
the Viceroy refused to pay him a peso.</p>

<p>Upon Burling's return, the vigilant American
Commander-in-Chief forwarded to Jefferson a report
of conditions in Mexico, as represented by
Burling, together with a request for fifteen hundred
dollars to pay that investigator's expenses.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>
The sole object of Burling's journey was, Wilkinson
informed the President, to observe and report upon
the situation in the great Spanish Vice-royalty as
recent events had affected it, with respect to the
interests of the United States; and Jefferson was assured
by the General that his agent was the soundest
and most devoted of patriots.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></p>

<p>To back up the character he was now playing,
Wilkinson showered warnings upon the officers of
the Army and upon government officials in New
Orleans. "The plot thickens.... My God! what a
situation has our country reached. Let us save it if
we can.... On the 15th of this month [November],
Burr's declaration is to be made in Tennessee and
Kentucky; hurry, hurry after me, and, if necessary,
let us be buried together, in the ruins of the place we
shall defend." This was a typical message to Colonel
Cushing.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson dispatched orders to Colonel Freeman
at New Orleans to repair the defenses of the city;
but "be you as silent as the grave.... You are sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>rounded
by secret agents."<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> He informed Governor
Claiborne that "the storm will probably burst in
New Orleans, where I shall meet it and triumph or
perish."<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> Otherwise "the fair fabric of our independence
... will be prostrated, and the Goddess of
Liberty will take her flight from the globe forever."
Again and again, Wilkinson sounded the alarm.
"Burr with rebellious bands may soon be at hand."
Therefore, "civil institutions must ... yield to the
strong arm of military law."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> But Claiborne must
"not breathe or even hint" that catastrophe was
approaching.</p>

<p>At last, however, Wilkinson unbosomed himself to
the merchants of New Orleans whom he assembled
for that purpose. Agents of the bandit chief were all
around them, he said&mdash;he would have arrested
them long since had he possessed the power. The
desperadoes were in larger force than he had at first
believed&mdash;"by all advices the enemy, at least 2000
strong," would soon reach Natchez. They meant,
first, to sack New Orleans and then to attack Mexico
by land and sea. If successful in that invasion, "the
Western States were then to be separated from the
Union." But Wilkinson would "pledge his life in the
defense of the city and his country."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

<p>At that moment Burr had not even started down
the Mississippi with his nine boats manned by sixty
young men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time the city was thrown into a panic.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> But
Wilkinson had overblustered. The people, recovered
from their fright, began to laugh. Thousands of
fierce Vandals, brandishing their arms, on their way
to take New Orleans, capture Mexico, destroy the
Union! And this mighty force not now far away!
How could that be and no tidings of it except from
Wilkinson? That hero witnessed with dismay this
turn of public sentiment. Ruthless action, then, or
all his complicated performances would go for
naught. Ridicule would be fatal to his plans.</p>

<p>So General James Wilkinson, as head of the Army
of the United States, began a reign of lawless violence
that has no parallel in American history. To
such base uses can authority be put&mdash;with such
peril to life and liberty is it invested&mdash;when unchecked
by Constitutional limitation enforced by
fearless and unprejudiced judges! Men were arrested
and thrown into prison on Wilkinson's orders, wholly
without warrant of law. The first thus to be seized
were Samuel Swartwout and Dr. Justus Erich Bollmann.
Their papers were confiscated; they were refused
counsel, were even denied access to the courts.
Soldiers carried them to a warship in the river which
at once set sail with orders from Wilkinson for the
delivery of the prisoners to the President at Washington.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Another man similarly arrested was Peter V. Ogden
of New York, nephew of Jonathan Dayton, who
had been the companion of Swartwout in his long
overland journey in quest of Wilkinson. Public-spirited
lawyers swore out writs of habeas corpus for
these three men. Not a syllable of evidence was adduced
against Ogden, who by some mischance had
not been transported with Bollmann and Swartwout,
and the court discharged him.</p>

<p>In response to the order of the court to produce
the bodies of Bollmann and Swartwout, Wilkinson
sent his aide with the General's return to the process.
As the "Commander of the Army of the United
States," he said, he took on himself "all responsibility
... resulting from the arrest of Erick Bollmann,
who is accused of being guilty of the crime of
treason against the government and the laws of the
United States," and he had "taken opportune
measures to warrant his safe delivery into the hands
of the President."</p>

<p>This had been done, avowed Wilkinson, solely in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
order "to secure the nation which is menaced to its
foundations by a band of traitors associated with
Aaron Burr." To that end he would, he defiantly informed
the court, "arrest, without respect to class
or station, all those against whom [he had] positive
proof of being accomplices in the machinations
against the state."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> This defiance of the courts was
accompanied by a copy of Wilkinson's version of
Burr's cipher letter and some memoranda by Bollmann,
together with Wilkinson's assertion that he
had certain evidence which he would not, at that
time, disclose.</p>

<p>Jefferson had long demanded of Wilkinson a copy
of the incriminating Burr letter, and this was now
forwarded, together with the General's account of
the arrest of Bollmann, Swartwout, and Ogden. In
his report to the President, Wilkinson accused the
judge who had released Ogden of being an associate
of Burr in his "treasonable combinations,"
and characteristically added that he would "look
to our country for protection" in case suit for damages
was brought against him by Bollmann and
Swartwout.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>While Bollmann and Swartwout, in close confinement
on the warship, were tossing on the winter
seas, the saturnalia of defiance of the law continued
in New Orleans. Ogden was again seized and incarcerated.
So was his friend, James Alexander of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
York, who had displeased Wilkinson by suing out
the writs of habeas corpus. Both were shortly taken
to a military prison. Judges, leading lawyers, prominent
citizens&mdash;all protested in vain. New writs of
habeas corpus were issued and ignored. Edward
Livingston sued out a writ of attachment<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> against
Wilkinson. It was defied. The civil governor was
appealed to; he was cowed and declined to act in
this "delicate as well as dangerous" state of things.
In despair and disgust Judge James Workman adjourned
the Orleans County Court <i>sine die</i> and resigned
from the Bench;<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> he too was seized by Wilkinson's
soldiers, and recovered his liberty only by
the return of the Judge of the United States District
Court, who dared the wrath of the military tyrant
in order to release his imprisoned fellow judge.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of this debauch of military lawlessness,
General John Adair, late one afternoon, rode
into New Orleans. He had come on business, having
sent three thousand gallons of whiskey and two boatloads
of provisions to be sold in the city, and expecting
also to collect a debt of fifteen hundred dollars
due him at that place; he had also intended to make
some land deals.</p>

<p>The moment Wilkinson heard of the arrival of his
old friend and comrade, the General ordered "a captain
and one hundred soldiers" to seize Adair. This
was done so peremptorily that he was not allowed to
dine, "altho the provision was ready on the table";<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
he was denied medicine, which on account of illness
he wished to take with him; he was refused extra
clothing and was not even allowed "to give directions
respecting his horses which cost him $700 in
Kentucky." Then the bewildered Adair was hurried
on board a schooner and taken "down the river 25
miles, landed on the other side ... and placed under
a tent in a swamp."</p>

<p>After he had been kept six days under guard
in this situation, Adair "was shipped aboard the
schooner Thatcher for Baltimore ... in the custody
of Lt. Luckett." Wilkinson ordered the lieutenant to
keep Adair in close confinement and to resist "with
force and arms" any civil officer who might attempt
to take Adair "by a writ of habeas corpus."<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>The reason for this particular atrocity was that
Wilkinson had written Adair the letters quoted
above, and unless his correspondent were discredited
and disgraced, he could convict Wilkinson of
the very conspiracy with which Burr was being
charged.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> During his reign of terror to put down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
"treason," the General was in secret communication
with the Spaniards, earning the bribe money
which he was, and long had been, receiving from
them.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>While Wilkinson at New Orleans was thus openly
playing despot and secretly serving Spain, the President's
Annual Message was read to Congress.</p>

<p>In this document Jefferson informed the National
Legislature of the advance of the Spaniards toward
American territory, the alarming posture of affairs,
the quick response of the pioneers to the call of the
Government for volunteers. "Having received information,"
he said, "that, in another part of the
United States, a great number of private individuals
were combining together, arming and organizing
themselves contrary to law, to carry on a military
expedition against the territories of Spain [he]
thought it necessary to take measures ... for suppressing
this enterprise ... and bringing to justice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
its authors and abettors."<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> Such was the slight
reference made to the Burr "conspiracy." Thanks
to the President's Proclamation, the "treasonable"
plot of Aaron Burr was already on every tongue; but
here, indeed, was an anti-climax.</p>

<p>The Senate referred the brief paragraph of the
President's Message relating to the conspiracy to a
special committee. The committee took no action.
Everybody was in suspense. What were the facts?
Nobody knew. But the air was thick with surmise,
rumor, conjecture, and strange fancies&mdash;none of
them bearing the color of truth.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> Marshall was then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
in Washington and must have heard all these tales
which were on every tongue.</p>

<p>In two weeks from the time Jefferson's Message
was read to Congress, John Randolph rose in his
place in the House, and in a speech of sharp criticism
both of Spain and of the President, demanded
that the President lay before Congress any information
in his possession concerning the conspiracy and
the measures taken to suppress it.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>A heated debate followed. Jefferson's personal
supporters opposed the resolution. It was, however,
generally agreed, as stated by George W. Campbell
of Tennessee, that "this conspiracy has been painted
in stronger colors than there is reason to think it deserves."
There was no real evidence, said Campbell;
nothing but "newspaper evidence."<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Finally that
part of the resolution calling for the facts as to the
conspiracy was passed by a vote of 109 yeas to 14
nays; while the clause demanding information as to
the measures Jefferson had taken was carried by 67
yeas to 52 nays.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>A week later the President responded in a Special
Message. His information as to the conspiracy was,
he said, a "voluminous mass," but there was in it
"little to constitute legal evidence." It was "chiefly
in the form of letters, often containing such a mixture
of rumors, conjectures, and suspicions, as renders
it difficult to sift out the real facts." On November
25, said Jefferson, he had received Wilkinson's
letter exposing Burr's evil designs which the General,
"with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
good citizen," had sent him, and which, "when
brought together" with some other information,
"developed Burr's general designs."<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>The President assured Congress that "one of
these was the severance of the Union of these States
beyond the Alleghany mountains; the other, an attack
on Mexico. A third object was provided ... the
settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of
country on the Washita." But "this was merely a
pretext." Burr had soon found that the Western
settlers were not to be seduced into secession; and
thereupon, said Jefferson, the desperado "determined
to seize upon New Orleans, plunder the bank
there, possess himself of the military and naval
stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico."
For this purpose Burr had "collected ... all the ardent,
restless, desperate, and disaffected persons"
within his reach.</p>

<p>Therefore the President made his Proclamation
of November 27, which had thwarted Burr's purposes.
In New Orleans, however, General Wilkinson
had been forced to take extreme measures for
the defense of the country against the oncoming
plunderers. Among these was the seizure of Bollmann
and Swartwout who were "particularly employed
in the endeavor to corrupt the General and
the Army of the United States," and who had been
sent oversea by Wilkinson for "ports in the Atlantic
states, probably on the consideration that an
impartial trial could not be expected ... in New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Orleans, and that the city was not as yet a safe
place of confinement."<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>As to Burr, Jefferson assured Congress that his
"<i>guilt is placed beyond question</i>."<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

<p>With this amazing Message the President sent an
affidavit of Wilkinson's, as well as two letters from
that veracious officer,<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> and a copy of Wilkinson's
version of Burr's letter to him from which the General
had carefully omitted the fact that the imprudent
message was in answer to a dispatch from
himself. But Jefferson did not transmit to Congress
the letter, dated October 21, 1806, which he
had received from Wilkinson.</p>

<p>Thoughtful men, who had personally studied
Burr for years and who were unfriendly to him,
doubted the accuracy of Wilkinson's version of the
Burr dispatch: "It sounds more like Wilkinson's
letter than Burr's," Senator Plumer records in his
diary. "There are ... some things in it quite irrelevant....
Burr's habits have been never to trust himself
on paper, if he could avoid it&mdash;when he wrote,
it was with great caution.... Wilkinson is not an
accurate correct man."<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>No such doubts, however, assailed the eager multitude.
The awful charge of treason had now been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
formally made against Burr by the President of the
United States. This, the most sensational part of
Jefferson's Message, at once caught and held the attention
of the public, which took for granted the
truth of it. From that moment the popular mind was
made up, and the popular voice demanded the life of
Aaron Burr. No mere trial in court, no adherence to
rules of evidence, no such insignificant fact as the
American Constitution, must be permitted to stand
between the people's aroused loyalty and the miscreant
whom the Chief Executive of the Nation had
pronounced guilty of treason.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_756_756" id="Footnote_756_756"></a><a href="#FNanchor_756_756"><span class="label">[756]</span></a> Hamilton's pursuit of Burr was lifelong and increasingly venomous.
It seems incredible that a man so transcendently great as Hamilton&mdash;easily
the foremost creative mind in American statesmanship&mdash;should
have succumbed to personal animosities such as he displayed
toward John Adams, and toward Aaron Burr.
</p><p>
The rivalry of Hamilton and Burr began as young attorneys at the
New York bar, where Burr was the only lawyer considered the equal
of Hamilton. Hamilton's open hostility, however, first showed itself
when Burr, then but thirty-five years of age, defeated Hamilton's
father-in-law, Philip Schuyler, for the United States Senate. The
very next year Hamilton prevented Burr from being nominated and
elected Governor of New York. Then Burr was seriously considered
for Vice-President, but Hamilton also thwarted this project.
</p><p>
When Burr was in the Senate, the anti-Federalists in Congress unanimously
recommended him for the French Mission; and Madison and
Monroe, on behalf of their colleagues, twice formally urged Burr's
appointment. Hamilton used his influence against it, and the appointment
was not made. At the expiration of Burr's term in the Senate,
Hamilton saw to it that he should not be chosen again and Hamilton's
father-in-law this time succeeded.
</p><p>
President Adams, in 1798, earnestly desired to appoint Burr to the
office of Brigadier-General under Washington in the provisional army
raised for the expected war with France. Hamilton objected so strenuously
that the President was forced to give up his design. (See
Adams to Rush, Aug. 25, 1805, <i>Old Family Letters</i>, 77; and same to
same, June 23, 1807, <i>ib.</i> 150.)
</p><p>
In the Presidential contest in the House in 1801 (see vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 533-38,
of this work), Burr, notwithstanding his refusal to do anything in his
own behalf (<i>ib.</i> 539-47), would probably have been elected instead of
Jefferson, had not Hamilton savagely opposed him. (<i>Ib.</i>)
</p><p>
When, in 1804, Burr ran for Governor of New York, Hamilton
again attacked him. It was for one of Hamilton's assaults upon him
during this campaign that Burr challenged him. (See Parton: <i>Life

dueling that, but for Hamilton's incalculable services in founding
the Nation and the lack of similar constructive work by Burr, the
hatred of Burr's political enemies and the fatal result of the duel,
there certainly would have been no greater outcry over the encounter
than over any of the similar meetings between public men during
that period.</p></div>

most eminent of Americans, such as Clay, Randolph, Jackson, and
Benton, fought on "the field of honor." In 1820 a resolution against
dueling, offered in the Senate by Senator Morrill of New Hampshire,
was laid on the table. (<i>Annals</i>, 16th Cong. 1st Sess. 630, 636.)</p></div>

the British Minister the rejection of the articles of the Boundary
Treaty in retaliation for the Senate's striking out one article of that
Convention. They did this, records the British Minister, because, as
they urged, such action by the British Government "would prove to be
a great exciting cause to them [the New England Secessionists] to go
forward rapidly in the steps which they have already commenced toward
a separation from the Southern part of the Union.
</p><p>
"The [Federalist] members of the Senate," continues Merry, "have
availed themselves of the opportunity of their being collected here to
hold private meetings on this subject, and ... their plans and calculations
respecting the event have been long seriously resolved.... They
naturally look forward to Great Britain for support and assistance
whenever the occasion shall arrive." (Merry to Hawkesbury, March

the Western people "if the Spaniards on their right, and Great Britain

western settlers (I speak now from my own observations) stand as it
were, upon a pivot. The touch of a feather would turn them any way....

criticized from the point of view of honesty. In 1799 there were in New
York City but two banking institutions, and both were controlled by
Federalists. These banks aided business men of the Federalist Party
and refused accommodation to Republican business men. The Federalists
controlled the Legislature and no State charter for another bank
in New York could be had.
</p><p>
Burr, as a member of the State Senate, secured from the Legislature
a charter for the Manhattan Company to supply pure water to the
city; but this charter authorized the use by the company of its surplus
capital in any lawful way it pleased. Thus was established a new bank
where Republican business men could get loans. Burr, in committee,
frankly declared that the surplus was to establish a bank, and Governor
Jay signed the bill. Although the whole project appears to have
been open and aboveboard as far as Burr was concerned, yet when the
bank began business, a violent attack was made on him. (Parton:
<i>Burr</i>, 237-40.) For charter see <i>Laws of New York</i> (Webster and
Skinner's edition), 1799, chap. 84.</p></div>

winter and Wilkinson learned of it some time in the spring. This fed
his alarm, first awakened by the rumors set afloat by Spanish agents
of which Clark had advised him. According to Davis and Parton,
Wilkinson's resolve to sacrifice Burr was now taken. (See Davis, <span class="smcap">ii</span>,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_821_821" id="Footnote_821_821"></a><a href="#FNanchor_821_821"><span class="label">[821]</span></a> This was that Burr with his desperadoes would seize the President
and other officers of the National Government, together with the public
money, arsenals, and ships. If, thereafter, he could not reconcile
the States to the new arrangement, the bandit chief and his followers
would sail for New Orleans and proclaim the independence of Louisiana.

Professor McCaleb says that this tale was a ruse to throw Casa Yrujo
off his guard as to the now widespread reports in Florida and Texas, as
well as America, of Burr's intended descent upon Mexico. (See McCaleb,
54-58.) It should be repeated that the proposals of Burr and
Dayton to Merry and Casa Yrujo were not publicly known for many
years afterward.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_828_828" id="Footnote_828_828"></a><a href="#FNanchor_828_828"><span class="label">[828]</span></a> Eaton had done good work as American Consul to Algiers, a post
to which he was appointed by President Adams. In 1804, Jefferson
appointed him United States Naval Agent to the Barbary States.
With the approval of the Administration, Eaton undertook to overthrow
the reigning Pasha of Tripoli and restore to the throne the
Pasha's brother, whom the former had deposed. In executing this
project Eaton showed a resourcefulness, persistence, and courage as
striking as the means he adopted were bizarre and the adventure itself
fantastic. (Allen: <i>Our Navy and the Barbary Corsairs</i>, 227 <i>et seq.</i>)
</p><p>
Eaton charged that the enterprise failed because the American fleet
did not properly co&ouml;perate with him, and because Tobias Lear,
American Consul-General to Algiers, compromised the dispute with
the reigning Bey whom Eaton's nondescript "army" was then heroically
fighting. (Eaton to the Secretary of the Navy, Aug. 9, 1805,
<i>Eaton</i>: Prentiss, 376.)
</p><p>
Full of wrath he returned to the United States, openly denouncing
all whom he considered in any way responsible for the African <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>,
and demanding payment of large sums which he alleged had been paid
by him in advancing American interests in Africa. (<i>Ib.</i> 393, 406; also
see Allen, 265.)</p></div>

</p><p>
That part of Eaton's account of Burr's conversation which differs
from those with Truxtun and Decatur is simply unaccountable. That
Burr was capable of anything may be granted; but his mind was
highly practical and he was uncommonly reserved in speech. Undoubtedly
Eaton had heard the common talk about the timidity and
supineness of the Government under Jefferson and had himself used
language such as he ascribed to Burr.
</p><p>
Whichever way one turns, no path out of the confusion appears.
But for Burr's abstemious habits (he was the most temperate of all
the leading men of that period) an explanation might be that he and
Eaton were very drunk&mdash;Burr recklessly so&mdash;if he indulged in this
uncharacteristic outburst of loquacity.</p></div>

</p><p>
Burr also told Jackson of John Randolph's denunciation of Jefferson's
"duplicity and imbecility," and of small politics receiving "more
of public attention than all our collisions with foreign powers, or than
all the great events on the theatre of Europe." He closed with the
statement, then so common, that such "things begin to make reflecting
men think, many good patriots to doubt, and some to despond."

(<i>Blennerhassett Papers</i>: Safford, 434), had had a picturesque
career. A graduate of G&ouml;ttingen, he lived in Paris during the
Revolution, went to London for a time, and from there to Vienna,
where he practiced medicine as a cover for his real design, which was
to discover the prison where Lafayette was confined and to rescue him
from it. This he succeeded in doing, but both were taken soon afterward.
Bollmann was imprisoned for many months, and then released
on condition that he leave Austria forever. He came to the United
States and entered into Burr's enterprise with unbounded enthusiasm.
His name often appears as "Erick Bolman" in American records.</p></div>

the motives that now animated the commander of the American
Army:
</p><p>
"Wilkinson is entirely devoted to us. He enjoys a considerable pension
from the King.... He anticipated ... the failure of an expedition
of this nature [Burr's invasion of Mexico]. Doubtless he foresaw
from the first that the improbability of success in case of making the
attempt would leave him like the dog in the fable with the piece of
meat in his mouth; that is, that he would lose [both] the honorable
employment ... [as American Commander] and the generous pension
he enjoys from the King. These considerations, secret in their nature,
he could not explain to Burr; and when the latter persisted in an idea
so fatal to Wilkinson's interests, nothing remained but to take the
course adopted.
</p><p>
"By this means he assures his pension; and will allege his conduct
on this occasion as an extraordinary service, either for getting it increased,
or for some generous compensation.
</p><p>
"On the other hand this proceeding secures his distinguished rank
in the military service of the United States, and covers him with a
popularity which may perhaps result in pecuniary advantages, and in
any case will flatter his vanity.
</p><p>
"In such an alternative he has acted as was to be expected; that is,

story. Swartwout's affidavit is important. He swears that he never
heard of the revolutionizing of "the N[ew] O[rleans] Territory" until
Wilkinson mentioned it&mdash;"I first heard of such a project from Wilkinson";
that Burr never had spoken of attacking Mexico except "in
case of war with Spain"; that if there were no war, Burr intended to
settle the Washita lands. (See Henshaw in <i>Quarterly Pub. Hist, and
Phil. Soc. Ohio</i>, <span class="smcap">ix</span>, Nos. 1 and 2, 53-54.)
</p><p>
This young man made a deep impression of honesty and straightforwardness
on all who came in contact with him. (See testimony of
Tazewell, Cabell, and Brokenbrough, <i>Annals</i>, 10th Cong. 1st Sess.
633.) "Swartwout is a fine genteel intelligible young man." (Plumer
to Mason, Jan. 30, 1807, Plumer MSS. Lib. Cong.)
</p><p>
Notwithstanding his frank and engaging manner, Swartwout was
at heart a basely dishonest person. Thirty years later, when Collector
of the Port of New York, he embezzled a million and a quarter
dollars of the public funds. (Bassett: <i>Life of Andrew Jackson</i>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>,

his arrest Wilkinson had borrowed his gold watch, and afterward refused
to return it. When the soldiers seized Swartwout they "hurried"
him across the river, lodged him "for several days &amp; nights in a poor
inhospitable shed&mdash;&amp; deprived of the necessaries of life."
</p><p>
Finally, when ordered to march with his guard&mdash;and being refused
any information as to where he was to be taken&mdash;the prisoner declared
that he was to be murdered and leapt into the river, crying, "I
had as well die here as in the woods," whereupon "the L<sup>t</sup> drew up his
file of six men &amp; ordered them to shoot him. The soldiers directed
their guns at him &amp; snapt them, but owing to the great rain, 3 of the
guns flashed in the pan, &amp; the other's would not take fire. The men
pursued &amp; took him. But for the wetness of the powder this unfortunate
young man must have be[en] murdered in very deed."
</p><p>
Swartwout was not permitted to take his clothing with him on the
ship that carried him to Baltimore; and the officer in charge of him was
under orders from Wilkinson to put his prisoner in chains during the
voyage. (Plumer, Feb. 21, 1807, "Register," Plumer MSS. Lib. Cong.)</p></div>

For this outrage Adair, within a year, brought suit against Wilkinson
for false imprisonment. This was bitterly fought for ten years, but
finally Adair secured judgment for $2500, "against which Wilkinson
was indemnified by Congress." (Hildreth, V, 627.)
</p><p>
For three or four years Adair continued in public disfavor solely
because of his supposed criminal connection with Burr, of which his
arrest by Wilkinson convinced the inflamed public mind. He slowly
recovered, however, rendered excellent service as an officer in the War
of 1812, and under Jackson commanded the Kentucky troops at the
battle of New Orleans with distinguished gallantry. In 1820 the old
veteran was elected Governor of Kentucky. Afterward he was chosen
Representative in Congress from his district.</p></div>

word of Adair's startling account of his arrest was true. It was never
even denied. John Watkins told Wilkinson of a conversation with
Adair immediately after the latter's arrival which showed that nobody
had reason to fear Burr: "He [Adair] observed ... that the bubble
would soon burst &amp; signified that the claims were without foundation
&amp; that he had seen nothing like an armament or preparations for
a warlike expedition." (Watkins to Wilkinson, Jan. 14, 1807, Wilkinson
MSS. Chicago Hist. Soc.)
</p><p>
Professor Cox has suggested to the author that Wilkinson's summary
arrest of Adair was to prevent the further circulation of his
statement.</p></div>

"I never believed him to be a Fool," wrote John Adams to his
most intimate friend. "But he must be an Idiot or a Lunatick if he
has really planned and attempted to execute such a Project as is imputed
to him." Politicians have "no more regard to Truth than the
Devil.... I suspect that this Lying Spirit has been at Work concerning
Burr.... But if his guilt is as clear as the Noon day Sun, the first
Magistrate ought not to have pronounced it so before a Jury had
tryed him." (Adams to Rush, Feb. 2, 1807, <i>Old Family Letters</i>,

<h3>THE CAPTURE AND ARRAIGNMENT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was President Jefferson who directed and animated the prosecution. (Winfield Scott.)</p>

<p>The President's popularity is unbounded and his will is that of the nation. (Joseph Nicholson.)</p>

<p>The press from one end of the continent to the other has been enlisted to
excite prejudices against Colonel Burr. (John Wickham.)</p>

<p>Two thirds of our speeches have been addressed to the people. (George Hay.)</p>

<p>It would be difficult or dangerous for a jury to acquit Burr, however innocent
they might think him. (Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>While Washington was still agitated by the President's
Special Message, the long winter voyage of
Bollmann and Swartwout ended at Baltimore, and
Burr's dazed dispatch-bearers were brought by
military guards to the National Capital. There, on
the evening of January 22, they were thrown into
the military prison at the Marine Barracks, and
"guarded, night and day, by an officer &amp; 15 soldiers
of the Marine Corps."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>The ship bearing James Alexander had made a
swift passage. On its arrival, friends of this prisoner
applied to Joseph F. Nicholson, now United States
Judge at Baltimore, for a writ of habeas corpus.
Alexander was at once set free, there being not the
slightest evidence to justify his detention.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>A week or two later the schooner Thatcher, on
board which was the disconsolate and dumbfounded
General Adair&mdash;Wilkinson's fourth prisoner to be
sent to Jefferson&mdash;tied up to its dock at Baltimore
and he was delivered "over to the commander of
the fort at that city." But a passenger on the vessel,
"a stranger ... of his own accord ... assured [Adair]
he would procure a writ of Habeas Corpus for him."
Adair also was "immediately liberated, ... there being
no evidence against him."<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<p>After the incarceration of Bollmann and Swartwout
in Washington, attorneys were secured for
them and an application was made to Judge William
Cranch, United States Judge for the District of Columbia,
for a writ of habeas corpus in their behalf,
directed to Colonel Wharton, who was in command
at Washington. Wharton brought the luckless prisoners
into court and stated that "he held them
under the orders of his superior officer. They were
then taken upon a bench warrant charging them
with treason which superseded the writ. A motion
was made by the prisoners council ... that they be
discharged. The Court required evidence of their
probable guilt."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson now took a hand in the prosecution.
He considered Wilkinson's affidavit insufficient<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> to
hold Bollmann and Swartwout, and, in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
strengthen the case against them, secured from
Eaton an affidavit stating the dire revelations which
Eaton alleged Burr had made to him a year before.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
Eaton's theatrical story was thus given to the
press,<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> and not only fortified the public conviction
that a conspiracy to destroy the Union had been
under way, but also horrified the country by the
account of Burr's intention to assassinate Jefferson.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General and the United States District
Attorney, representing the Government, demanded
that Bollmann and Swartwout be held;
Charles Lee, Robert Goodloe Harper, and Francis S.
Key, attorneys for the prisoners, insisted that they
be released. Long was the argument and "vast"
the crowd that heard it; "collected &amp; firm" was the
appearance of the accused men.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> So universal was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the curiosity, says John Quincy Adams, that the
Senate was "scarcely able here to form a quorum ...
and the House ... actually adjourned."<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> The court
decided that Bollmann and Swartwout should be
sent back to prison "for trial without bail or main-prize."
For the first time in our history a National
court divided on political grounds. Judge Cranch,
a Federalist first appointed by President Adams,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
thought that the prisoners should be discharged,
but was overruled by his associates, Judges Nicholas
Fitzhugh and Allen Bowie Duckett, Republicans
appointed by Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>But John Marshall and the Supreme Court had
yet to be reckoned with. Counsel for the reimprisoned
men at once applied to that tribunal for a writ
of habeas corpus, and Marshall directed process to
the jailer to show cause why the writ should not
issue.</p>

<p>An extreme and violent step was now taken to
end the proceedings in court. On Friday, January
23, 1807, the day after the President's Special Message
denouncing Burr had been read in the Senate,
Senator Giles, who, it should be repeated, was Jefferson's
personal representative in that body, actually
moved the appointment of a committee to draft a
bill "to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
corpus." Quickly Giles himself reported the measure,
the Senate suspended its rules, and the bill was
hurriedly passed, only Bayard of Delaware voting
against it.<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> More astounding still, Giles recommended,
and the Senate adopted, a special message
to the House, stating the Senate's action "which
they think expedient to communicate to you in confidence,"
and asking the popular branch of Congress
to pass the Senate bill without delay.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the House convened on Monday,
January 26,<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Senator Samuel Smith of Maryland
appeared on the floor and delivered this "confidential
message," together with the Senate bill, which
provided that "in all cases, where any person or persons,
charged on oath with treason, misprision of
treason, or other high crime or misdemeanor ... shall
be arrested or imprisoned ... the privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus shall be ... suspended, for and during
the term of three months."<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>The House was astounded. Party discipline was,
for the moment, wrathfully repudiated. Mr. Philip
R. Thompson of Virginia instantly moved that the
"message and the bill received from the Senate
ought not to be kept secret and that the doors be
opened." Thompson's motion was adopted by 123
yeas to 3 nays.</p>

<p>Then came a motion to reject the bill, followed by
a brief and almost one-sided debate, which was little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
more than the angry protest of the representatives
of the people against the proposed overthrow of this
last defense of liberty. William A. Burwell of Virginia
asked whether there was any danger "to justify
this suspension of this most important right of
the citizen.... He could judge from what he had
already seen that men, who are perfectly innocent,
would be doomed to ... undergo the infamy of the
dungeon."<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> "Never," exclaimed John W. Eppes
of the same State, "under this Government, has
personal liberty been held at the will of a single
individual."<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Joseph B. Varnum of Massachusetts
said that Burr's "insurrection" was the
worst in all history.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> James Sloan of New Jersey
made a similar statement.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> But the House promptly
rejected the Senate bill by 113 yeas to 19 nays. The
shameful attempt to prevent John Marshall from
deciding whether Bollmann and Swartwout were entitled
to the benefit of the most sacred writ known to
the law was thereby defeated and the Chief Justice
was left free to grant or reject it, as justice might
require.</p>

<p>The order of the court of the District of Columbia
was that Bollmann and Swartwout "be committed to
prison of this court, to take their trial for treason
against the United States, by levying war against
them."<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> In the Supreme Court the prisoners and the
Government were represented by the same counsel
who had argued the case below, and Luther Martin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
also appeared in behalf of the men whose long-continued
and, as he believed, wholly illegal suffering had
aroused the sympathies of that admirable lawyer.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court first decided that it had jurisdiction.
The application for the writs of habeas corpus
was, in effect, an appeal from the decision of the
District Court. On this point Justice Johnson delivered
a dissenting opinion, observing, as an aside,
that the argument for the prisoners had shown "an
unnecessary display of energy and pathos."<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> The
affidavit of General Wilkinson and his version of the
Burr letter, concerning which "the court had difficulty,"
were admitted by a vote of the majority
of the Justices. At noon on the twenty-first day of
February, 1807, Marshall delivered the opinion of
the majority of the court upon the main question,<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>
"whether the accused shall be discharged or held to
trial."</p>

<p>The specific charge was that of "treason in levying
war against the United States." This, declared
Marshall, was the most serious offense of which any
man can be accused: "As there is no crime which can
more excite and agitate the passions of men than
treason, no charge demands more from the tribunal
before which it is made a deliberate and temperate
inquiry. Whether this inquiry be directed to the fact
or to the law, none can be more solemn, none more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
important to the citizen or to the government; none
can more affect the safety of both."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="600" height="790" alt="John Marshall by Richard N. Brooke" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>John Marshall<br />
<small>From a painting by Richard N. Brooke</small></i></span>
</div>

<p>In order that it should never be possible to extend
treason "to offenses of minor importance," the Constitution
"has given a rule on the subject both to the
legislatures and the courts of America, which neither
can be permitted to transcend." Marshall then read,
with solemn impressiveness, these words from the
Constitution of the United States: "Treason against
the United States shall consist only in levying war
against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving
them aid and comfort."</p>

<p>To support the charge against Bollmann and
Swartwout, said Marshall, "war must be actually
levied.... To conspire to levy war, and actually to
levy war, are distinct offenses. The first must be
brought into open action by the assemblage of men
for a purpose treasonable in itself, or the fact of levying
war cannot have been committed." It was not
necessary for the commission of this crime that a
man should actually "appear in arms against his
country.... If a body of men be actually assembled
for the purpose of effecting by force a treasonable
purpose; all those who perform any part, however
minute, or however remote from the scene of the
action, and who are actually leagued in the general
conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> This
passage was soon to cause Marshall great embarrassment
when he was confronted with it in the trial of
Aaron Burr at Richmond.</p>

<p>Did this mean that men who go to the very edge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
of legal boundaries&mdash;who stop just short of committing
treason&mdash;must go scathless? By no means!
Such offenses could be and must be provided for by
statute. They were not, like treason, Constitutional
crimes. "The framers of our Constitution ... must
have conceived it more safe that punishment in such
cases should be ordained by general laws, formed
upon deliberation, under the influence of no resentments,
and without knowing on whom they were to
operate, than that it should be inflicted under the
influence of those passions which the occasion seldom
fails to excite, and which a flexible definition of the
crime, or a construction which would render it flexible,
might bring into operation."</p>

<p>This was a direct rebuke to Jefferson. There can
be no doubt that Marshall was referring to the
recent attempt to deprive Bollmann and Swartwout
of the protection of the courts by suspending the
writ of habeas corpus. "It is, therefore, more safe,"
continued Marshall, "as well as more consonant to
the principles of our constitution, that the crime of
treason should not be extended by construction to
doubtful cases; and that crimes not clearly within the
constitutional definition should receive such punishment
as the legislature in its wisdom may provide."</p>

<p>What do the words "levying war" mean? To
complete that crime, Marshall repeated, "there must
be an actual assemblage of men for the purpose of
executing a treasonable design ... but no conspiracy
for this object, no enlisting of men to effect it,
would be an actual levying of war."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> He then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
applied these principles to the testimony. First he
took up the deposition of Eaton<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> which, he said,
indicated that the invasion of Mexico "was the
immediate object"<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> that Burr had in mind.</p>

<p>But, asked the Chief Justice, what had this to do
with Bollmann and Swartwout? The prosecution
connected the prisoners with the statements made
in Eaton's deposition by offering the affidavit of
General Wilkinson, which included his version of
Burr's celebrated letter. Marshall then overruled
the "great and serious objections made" to the admission
of Wilkinson's affidavit. One of these objections
was to that part which purported to set out the
Wilkinson translation of the Burr cipher, the original
letter not having been presented. Marshall announced
that "a division of opinion has taken place
in the court," two of the Judges believing such testimony
totally inadmissible and two others holding
that it was proper to consider it "at this incipient
stage of the prosecution."</p>

<p>Thereupon Marshall analyzed Wilkinson's version
of Burr's confidential cipher dispatch.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> It was so
vague, said the Chief Justice, that it "furnishes no
distinct view of the design of the writer." But the
"co&ouml;peration" which Burr stated had been secured
"points strongly to some expedition against the
territories of Spain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>Marshall then quoted these words of Burr's famous
message: "'Burr's plan of operations is to
move down rapidly from the falls on the 15th of
November, with the first 500 or 1,000 men in the
light boats now constructing for that purpose, to be
at Natchez between the 5th and 15th of December,
there to meet Wilkinson; then to determine whether
it will be expedient in the first instance to seize on,
or to pass by, Baton Rouge. The people of the country
to which we are going are prepared to receive us.
Their agents now with Burr say that if we will protect
their religion, and will not subject them to a
foreign power, in three weeks all will be settled.'"</p>

<p>This language was, said Marshall, "rather more
explicit." But "there is no expression in these sentences
which would justify a suspicion that any
territory of the United States was the object of the
expedition. For what purpose seize on Baton Rouge?
Why engage Spain against this enterprise, if it was
designed against the United States?"<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p>Burr's statement that "the people of the country
to which we are going are prepared to receive us,"
was, said Marshall, "peculiarly appropriate to a
foreign country." And what was the meaning of the
statement: "Their agents now with Burr say, that
if we will protect their religion, and will not subject
them to a foreign power, in three weeks all will be
settled"? It was not probable that this referred to
American citizens; but it perfectly fitted the Mexicans.
"There certainly is not in the letter delivered
to General Wilkinson ... one syllable which has a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
necessary or a natural reference to an enterprise
against the territory of the United States."</p>

<p>According to Wilkinson's affidavit, Swartwout
knew the contents of the dispatch he was carrying;
Wilkinson had deposed that Burr's messenger
had frankly said so. Without stating that, in his
long journey from New York through the Western
States and Territories in quest of Wilkinson, he had
"performed on his route any act whatever which
was connected with the enterprise," Swartwout had
declared "their object to be 'to carry an expedition to
the Mexican provinces.'"<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> This, said Marshall, was
"explanatory of the letter of Col. Burr, if the expressions
of that letter could be thought ambiguous."</p>

<p>But Wilkinson declared in his affidavit that
Swartwout had also told him that "this territory
would be revolutionized where the people were ready
to join them, and that there would be some seizing,
he supposed at New Orleans."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> If this meant that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
the Government in any American territory was to
be revolutionized by force, "although merely as a
... means of executing some greater projects, the
design was unquestionably treasonable," said Marshall;
"and any assemblage of men for that purpose
would amount to a levying of war." It was, then,
of first importance to discover the true meaning of
the youthful and indiscreet messenger.</p>

<p>For the third time the court divided. "Some of
the judges," Marshall explained, suppose that these
words of Swartwout "refer to the territory against
which the expedition was intended; others to that in
which the conversation was held. Some consider the
words, if even applicable to a territory of the United
States, as alluding to a revolution to be effected by
the people, rather than by the party conducted by
Col. Burr."</p>

<p>Swartwout's statement, as given in Wilkinson's
affidavit, that Burr was assembling thousands of
armed men to attack Mexico, did not prove that
Burr had gathered an army to make war on the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> If the latter were Burr's purpose, it
was not necessary that the entire host should have
met at one spot; if detachments had actually formed
and were marching to the place of rendezvous, treason
had been committed. Following his tedious
habit of repeating over and over again, often in
identical language, statements already clearly made,
Marshall for the fourth time asserted that there
must be "unequivocal evidence" of "an actual
assemblage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>The mere fact that Burr "was enlisting men in
his service ... would not amount to levying war."
That Swartwout meant only this, said Marshall, was
"sufficiently apparent." If seven thousand men had
actually come together in one body, every one would
know about it; and surely, observed Marshall,
"some evidence of such an assembling would have
been laid before the court."</p>

<p>Burr's intention to do certain "seizing at New
Orleans" did not amount to levying war from anything
that could be inferred from Swartwout's
statement. It only "indicated a design to rob."
Having thus examined all the testimony before the
court, Marshall announced the opinion of the majority
of the Justices that there was not "sufficient
evidence of his [Swartwout's] levying war against
the United States to justify his commitment on the
charge of treason."<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></p>

<p>The testimony against Bollmann was, if possible,
still weaker. There was, indeed, "no evidence to
support a charge of treason" against him. Whoever
believed the assertions in Wilkinson's affidavit could
not doubt that both Bollmann and Swartwout
"were engaged in a most culpable enterprise against
the dominions of a power at peace with the United
States"; but it was apparent that "no part of this
crime was committed in the District of Columbia."
They could not, therefore, be tried in that District.</p>

<p>Upon that point the court was at last unanimous.
The accused men could have been tried in New
Orleans&mdash;"there existed a tribunal in that city,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
sarcastically observed Marshall; but to say that
citizens might be seized by military power in the
jurisdiction where the alleged crime was committed
and thereafter tried "in any place which the general
might select, and to which he might direct them
to be carried," was not to be thought of&mdash;such
a thing "would be extremely dangerous." So the
long-suffering Bollmann and Swartwout were discharged.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>Thus, by three different courts, five of the "conspirators"
had successively been released. In the
case of Ogden, there was no proof; of Alexander, no
proof; of Adair, no proof; of Bollmann and Swartwout,
no proof. And the Judges had dared to set free
the accused men&mdash;had refused to consign them to
prison, despite public opinion and the desire of the
Administration. Could anything be more undemocratic,
more reprehensible? The Supreme Court,
especially, should be rebuked.</p>

<p>On learning of that tribunal's action, Giles adjourned
the meeting of his committee on the treason
bill in order to secure immediately a copy of
Marshall's opinion. In a true Virginian rage, Giles
threatened to offer an amendment to the Constitution
"taking away <i>all</i> jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in criminal cases." There was talk of impeaching
every occupant of the Supreme Bench.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>More news had now reached Washington concerning
the outrages committed at New Orleans; and on
the day that the attorneys for Bollmann and Swart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>wout
applied to the Supreme Court for writs of habeas
corpus, James M. Broom of Delaware rose in
the House, and introduced a resolution "to make
further provision for securing the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus to persons in custody under
or by color of the authority of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>
While the cases were being argued in the Supreme
Court and the divided Judges were wrangling over
the disputed points, a violent debate sprang up in
the House over Broom's resolution. "If, upon every
alarm of conspiracy," said Broom, "our rights of
personal liberty are to be entrusted to the keeping of
a military commander, we may prepare to take our
leave of them forever."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> All day the debate continued;
on the next day, February 18, while Marshall
was delivering his opinion that the Supreme
Court had jurisdiction of the application of Bollmann
and Swartwout, the controversy in the House
was renewed.</p>

<p>James Elliot of Vermont said that "most of the
privileges intended to be secured" by the Fourth,
Fifth, and Sixth Amendments<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> "have recently been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
denied ... at the point of the bayonet, and under
circumstances of peculiar violence." He read Wilkinson's
impertinent return to the Orleans County
Court. This, said Elliot, was "not obedience to
the laws ... but ... defiance.... What necessity could
exist for seizing one or two wandering conspirators,
and transporting them fifteen hundred or two thousand
miles from the Constitutional scene of inquisition
and trial, to place them particularly under the
eye of the National Government"?<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> Not only was
the swish of the party whip heard in the House,
he asserted, but members who would not desert
the fundamentals of liberty must "be prepared for
the insinuation that we countenance treason, and
sympathize with traitors."<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

<p>The shrill voice of John Randolph was heard.
Almost his first sentence was a blow at Jefferson. If
the President and his party "ever quit the ground of
trial by jury, the liberty of the press, and the subordination
of the military to the civil authority, they
must expect that their enemies will perceive the desertion
and avail themselves of the advantage."<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>
Randolph assailed the recent attempt to suspend
the writ of habeas corpus which, he said, "was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>tended
... to cover with a mantle the most daring
usurpation which ever did, will, or can happen, in
this or any country. There was exactly as much
right to shoot the persons in question as to do what
has been done."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> The Declaration of Independence
had assigned wrongs of precisely the kind suffered by
Bollmann and Swartwout "as one of the grievances
imposed by the British Government on the colonies.
Now, it is done under the Constitution," exclaimed
Randolph, "and under a republican administration,
and men are transported without the color of law,
nearly as far as across the Atlantic."<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>Again and again angry speakers denounced the
strenuous attempts of the Administration's supporters
to influence Republican votes on partisan
grounds. Only by the most desperate efforts was
Jefferson saved from the rebuke and humiliation of
the passage of the resolution. But his escape was
narrow. Indefinite postponement was voted by the
dangerous majority of 2 out of a total of 118 members.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>While Burr's messengers were on the high seas,
prisoners of war, and Wilkinson at New Orleans
was saving the Republic by rending its laws, Burr
himself, ignorant of all, was placidly making his way
down the Ohio and Mississippi with his nine boats
and sixty adventurers, mostly youths, many only
boys. He had left Jackson at Nashville on December
22, and floating down the Cumberland in two
unarmed boats, had joined the remainder of the
little expedition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>He then met for the first time the young adventurers
whom Blennerhassett, Comfort Tyler of
Syracuse, New York, and Davis Floyd of the tiny
settlement of New Albany, Indiana Territory, had
induced to join the expedition. On a cold, rainy December
morning they were drawn up in a semi-circle
on a little island at the mouth of the Cumberland
River, and Burr was introduced to each of them.
Greeting them with his customary reserved friendliness,
he told them that the objects of the expedition
not already disclosed to them would be revealed at
a more opportune time.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p>Such was the second "overt act" of the gathering
of an armed host to "levy war" on the United
States for which Jefferson later fastened the charge
of treason upon Aaron Burr.</p>

<p>As it floated down the Ohio and Mississippi, the
little flotilla<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> stopped at the forts upon the river
bluffs, and the officers proffered Burr all the courtesies
at their command. Seven days after Burr had
left Fort Massac, Captain Bissel, in answer to a letter
of inquiry from Andrew Jackson, assured him
that "there has nothing the least alarming appeared";
Burr had passed with a few boats "having
nothing on board that would even suffer a conjecture,
more than a man bound to market."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Murrell of Tennessee, sent on a secret mission of
investigation, reported to Jackson that, pursuant to
instructions, he had closely followed and examined
Burr's movements on the Cumberland; that he had
heard reports that Burr "had gone down the river
with one thousand armed men"; but Murrell had
found the fact to be that there were but ten boats
with only "sixty men on board," and "no appearance
of arms."<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a></p>

<p>During the week when John Randolph, in the
House, was demanding information of the President,
and Wilkinson, in New Orleans, was making his
second series of arrests, Burr, with his little group
of boats and small company of men&mdash;totally unequipped
for anything but the settlement of the
Washita lands, and poorly supplied even for that&mdash;serenely
drew up to the landing at the small post of
Bayou Pierre in the Territory of Mississippi. He
was still uninformed of what was going forward at
New Orleans and at Washington&mdash;still unconscious
of the storm of hatred and denunciation that had
been blown up against him.</p>

<p>At the little settlement, Burr learned for the first
time of the fate prepared for him. Bloody and violent
were the measures he then adopted! He wrote a
letter to Cowles Mead, Acting Governor of the Territory,
stating that rumors he had just heard were
untrue; that "his object is agriculture and his boats
are the vehicles of immigration." But he "hinted
at resistance to any attempt to coerce him."<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>What followed was related by Mead himself. As
directed by the War Department, he had prorogued
the Legislature, put the Territory in a state of defense,
and called out the militia. When Burr's letter
came, Mead ordered these frontier soldiers to "rendezvous
at certain points.... With the promptitude
of Spartans, our fellow-citizens shouldered their
firelocks, and in twenty-four hours I had the honor
to review three hundred and seventy-five men at
Natches, prepared to defend their country." Mead
sent two aides to Burr, "who tendered his respects
to the civil authority." The Acting Governor himself
then saw Burr, whereupon the desperado actually
"offered to surrender himself to the civil authority
of the Territory, and to suffer his boats to be
searched." This was done by "four gentlemen of
unquestionable respectability, with a detachment of
thirty men." Burr readily went into court and
awaited trial.</p>

<p>"Thus, sir," concludes Governor Mead, "this
mighty alarm, with all its exaggeration, has eventuated
in nine boats and one hundred men,<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> and
the major part of these are boys, or young men
just from school," wholly unaware of Burr's evil
designs.<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>The Legislature of the Territory of Orleans had
just convened. Governor Claiborne recommended
that a law be passed suspending the writ of habeas
corpus. Behind closed doors the Representatives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
were harangued by Wilkinson on the subject of the
great conspiracy. All the old horrors were again
paraded to induce the legislators to support Wilkinson
in his lawless acts. Instead, that body denied the
existence of treason in Louisiana, expressed alarm at
the "late privation" of the rights of American citizens,
and determined to investigate the "measures
and motives" of Wilkinson. A memorial to Congress
was adopted, denouncing "the acts of high-handed
military power ... too notorious to be denied, too
illegal to be justified, too wanton to be excused," by
which "the temple of justice" had been "sacrilegiously
rifled."<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a></p>

<p>In Mississippi, Burr calmly awaited his trial before
the United States Court of that Territory. Bail
in the sum of five thousand dollars had been furnished
by Colonel Benijah Osmun and Lyman Harding,
two Revolutionary comrades of Burr, who years
before had emigrated to Mississippi and developed
into wealthy planters. Colonel Osmun invited Burr
to be his guest. Having seen the ogre and talked with
him, the people of the neighborhood became Burr's
enthusiastic friends.</p>

<p>Soon the grand jury was impaneled to investigate
Burr's "crimes" and indict him for them if a true
bill could be found. This body outdid the performance
of the Kentucky grand jury nine weeks earlier.
The grand jurors asserted that, after examining the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
evidence, they were "of the opinion that Aaron
Burr has not been guilty of any crime or misdemeanor
against the laws of the United States or of
this Territory or given any just alarm or inquietude
to the good people of this Territory." Worse still
followed&mdash;the grand jury formally presented as "a
grievance" the march of the militia against Burr,
since there had been no prior resistance by him to
the civil authorities. Nor did the grand jurors stop
there. They also presented "as a grievance, destructive
of personal liberty," Wilkinson's military outrages
in New Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p>When the grand jury was dismissed, Burr asked to
be discharged and his sureties released from his
bond. The judge was Thomas Rodney, the father
of C&aelig;sar A. Rodney whom Jefferson soon afterward
appointed Attorney-General. Judge Rodney out-Wilkinsoned
Wilkinson; he denied Burr's request
and ordered him to renew his bond or go to jail. This
was done despite the facts that the grand jury had
refused to indict Burr and that there was no legal
charge whatever before the court.</p>

<p>Wilkinson was frantic lest Burr escape him. Every
effort was made to seize him; officers in disguise
were sent to capture him,<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> and men "armed with
Dirks &amp; Pistolls" were dispatched to assassinate
him.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> Burr consulted Colonel Osmun and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
friends, who advised him to keep out of sight for a
time. So he went into hiding, but wrote the Governor
that he would again come before the court
when he could be assured of being dealt with legally.</p>

<p>Thereupon the bond of five thousand dollars,
which Judge Rodney had compelled Burr to give,
was declared forfeited and a reward of two thousand
dollars was offered for his apprehension. From his
place of retreat the harried man protested by letter.
The Governor would not relent. Wilkinson was raging
in New Orleans. Illegal imprisonment, probably
death, was certain for Burr if he should be taken.
His friends counseled flight, and he acted on their
judgment.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<p>But he would not go until he had seen his disconsolate
followers once more. Stealthily visiting his
now unguarded flotilla, he told his men to take for
themselves the boats and provisions, and, if they
desired, to proceed to the Washita lands, settle
there, and keep as much as they wanted. He had
stood his trial, he said, and had been acquitted; but
now he was to be taken by unlawful violence, and
the only thing left for him to do was to "flee from
oppression."<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Osmun gave him the best horse in his
stables. Clad "in an old blanket-coat begirt with a
leathern strap, to which a tin cup was suspended on
the left and a scalping knife on the right," Aaron
Burr rode away into the wilderness.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock of a rainy night, on the very day
when Marshall delivered his first opinion in the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of Bollmann and Swartwout, Burr was recognized
at a forest tavern in Washington County,<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> where
he had stopped to inquire the way to the house of
Colonel Hinson, whom he had met at Natchez on
his first Western journey and who had invited Burr
to be his guest if he ever came to that part of the
Territory. "Major" Nicholas Perkins, a burly backwoods
lawyer from Tennessee, penetrated the disguise,<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>
because of Burr's fine eyes and erect carriage.</p>

<p>Perkins hurried to the cabin of Theodore Brightwell,
sheriff of the county, and the two men rode
after Burr, overtaking him at the residence of
Colonel Hinson, who was away from home and
whose wife had prepared supper for the wanderer.
Brightwell went inside while Perkins remained in the
downpour watching the house from the bushes.</p>

<p>Burr so won the hearts of both hostess and sheriff
that, instead of arresting him, the officer proposed
to guide the escaping criminal on his way the next
morning.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> The drenched and shivering Perkins, feeling
that all was not right inside the cabin, hastened
by horse and canoe to Fort Stoddert and told Captain
Edward P. Gaines of Burr's whereabouts. With
a file of soldiers the captain and the lawyer set off to
find and take the fugitive. They soon met him with
the sheriff, who was telling Burr the roads to follow.</p>

<p>Exclusively upon the authority of Jefferson's Proc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>lamation,
Burr was arrested and confined in the fort.
With quiet dignity, the "traitor" merely protested
and asked to be delivered to the civil courts. His
arrest was wholly illegal, he correctly said; let a
judge and jury again pass on his conduct. But seizure
and incarceration by military force, utterly without
warrant of law, were a denial of fundamental
rights&mdash;rights which could not be refused to the
poorest citizen or the most abandoned criminal.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p>Two weeks passed before Burr was sent northward.
During this period all within the stockades
became his friends. The brother of Captain Gaines
fell ill and Burr, who among other accomplishments
knew much about medicine, treated the sick
man and cheered him with gay conversation. The
soldiers liked Burr; the officers liked him; their
wives liked him. Everybody yielded to his strange
attractiveness.</p>

<p>Two weeks after Marshall discharged Bollmann
and Swartwout at Washington, Burr was delivered
by Captain Gaines to a guard of nine men organized
by Perkins; and, preceded and followed by them, he
began the thousand-mile journey to Washington.
For days torrential rains fell; streams were swollen;
the soil was a quagmire. For hundreds of miles the
only road was an Indian trail; wolves filled the forest;
savage Indians were all about.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> At night the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
party, drenched and chilled, slept on the sodden
earth. Burr never complained.</p>

<p>After ten days the first white settlements appeared.
In two days more, South Carolina was
reached. The cautious Perkins avoided the larger
settlements, for Burr was popular in that State and
his captor would run no risks of a rescue. As the
prisoner and his convoy were passing through a village,
a number of men were standing before a tavern.
Burr suddenly threw himself from his horse and
cried: "I am Aaron Burr, under military arrest, and
claim the protection of the civil authorities."</p>

<p>Before any one could move, Perkins sprang to
Burr's side, a pistol in each hand, and ordered him
to remount. Burr refused; and the gigantic frontier
lawyer lifted the slight, delicate prisoner in his
hands, threw him into his saddle, and the sorry cavalcade
rode on, guards now on either side, as well as
before and behind their charge. Then, for the first
and last time in his life, Burr lost his composure, but
only for a moment; tears filled his eyes, but instantly
recovering his self-possession, he finished the remainder
of that harrowing trip as courteous, dignified,
and serene as ever.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a></p>

<p>At Fredericksburg, Virginia, Perkins received orders
from the Government to take his prisoner to
Richmond instead of to Washington. John Randolph
describes the cavalcade: "Colonel Burr ...
passed by my door the day before yesterday under
a strong guard.... To guard against enquiry as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
much as possible he was accoutred in a shabby suit
of homespun with an old white hat flopped over his
face, the dress in which he was apprehended."<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

<p>In such fashion, when the candles were being
lighted on the evening of Thursday, March 26, 1807,
Aaron Burr was brought into the Virginia Capital,
where, before a judge who could be neither frightened
nor cajoled, he was to make final answer to the
charge of treason.</p>

<p>Burr remained under military guard until the arrival
of Marshall at Richmond. The Chief Justice
at once wrote out,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> signed, and issued a warrant by
virtue of which the desperate yet composed prisoner
was at last surrendered to the civil authorities, before
whom he had so long demanded to be taken.</p>

<p>During the noon hour on Monday, March 30,
Marshall went to "a retired room" in the Eagle
Tavern. In this hostelry Burr was confined. Curious
citizens thronged the big public room of the inn
and were "awfully silent and attentive" as the pale
and worn conspirator was taken by Major Joseph
Scott, the United States Marshal, and two deputies
through the quiet but hostile assemblage to
the apartment where the Chief Justice awaited him.
To the disappointment of the crowd, the door was
closed and Aaron Burr stood before John Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>George Hay, the United States District Attorney,
had objected to holding even the beginning of the
preliminary hearing at the hotel, because the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
number of eager and antagonistic spectators could
not be present. Upon the sentiment of these, as will
be seen, Hay relied, even more than upon the law
and the evidence, to secure the conviction of the
accused man. He yielded, however, on condition
that, if any discussion arose among counsel, the
proceedings should be adjourned to the Capitol.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine two men more
unlike in appearance, manner, attire, and characteristics,
than the prisoner and the judge who now
confronted each other; yet, in many respects, they
were similar. Marshall, towering, ramshackle, bony,
loose-jointed, negligently dressed, simple and unconventional
of manner; Burr, undersized and erect,
his apparel scrupulously neat,<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> his deportment that
of the most punctilious society. Outwardly, the two
men resembled each other in only a single particular:
their eyes were as much alike as their persons
were in contrast.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> Burr was fifty years of age, and
Marshall was less than six months older.</p>

<p>Both were calm, admirably poised and self-possessed;
and from the personality of each radiated a
strange power of which no one who came near either
of them could fail to be conscious. Intellectually,
also, there were points of remarkable similarity.
Clear, cold logic was the outstanding element of
their minds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men had the gift of lucid statement,
although Marshall indulged in tiresome repetition
while Burr never restated a point or an argument.
Neither ever employed imagery or used any kind
of rhetorical display. Notwithstanding the rigidity
of their logic, both were subtle and astute; it was
all but impossible to catch either off his guard. But
Marshall gave the impression of great frankness;
while about every act and word of Burr there was
the air of mystery. The feeling which Burr's actions
inspired, that he was obreptitious, was overcome by
the fascination of the man when one was under his
personal influence; yet the impression of indirectness
and duplicity which he caused generally, together
with his indifference to slander and calumny,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> made
it possible for his enemies, before his Western venture,
to build up about his name a structure of public
suspicion, and even hatred, wholly unjustified by the
facts.</p>

<p>The United States District Attorney laid before
Marshall the record in the case of Bollmann and
Swartwout in the Supreme Court, and Perkins
proudly described how he had captured Burr and
brought him to Richmond. Hay promptly moved
to commit the accused man to jail on the charges of
treason and misdemeanor. The attorneys on both
sides agreed that on this motion there must be
argument. Marshall admitted Burr to bail in the
sum of five thousand dollars for his appearance
the next day at the court-room in the Capitol.</p>

<p>When Marshall opened court the following morn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>ing,
the room was crowded with spectators, while
hundreds could not find admittance. Hay asked
that the court adjourn to the House of Delegates, in
order that as many as possible of the throng might
hear the proceedings. Marshall complied, and the
eager multitude hurried pell-mell to the big ugly
hall, where thenceforth court was held throughout
the tedious, exasperating months of this historic
legal conflict.</p>

<p>Hay began the argument. Burr's cipher letter to
Wilkinson proved that he was on his way to attack
Mexico at the time his villainy was thwarted by the
patriotic measures of the true-hearted commander
of the American Army. Hay insisted that Burr had
intended to take New Orleans and "make it the
capital of his empire." The zealous young District
Attorney "went minutely into ... the evidence."
The prisoner's stealthy "flight from justice" showed
that he was guilty.</p>

<p>John Wickham, one of Burr's counsel, answered
Hay. There was no testimony to show an overt act
of treason. The alleged Mexican project was not
only "innocent, but meritorious"; for everybody
knew that we were "in an intermediate state between
war and peace" with Spain. Let Marshall
recall Jefferson's Message to Congress on that point.
If war did not break out, Burr's expedition was
perfectly suitable to another and a wholly peaceful
enterprise, and one which the President himself
had "recommended"&mdash;namely, "strong settlements
beyond the Mississippi."<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>Burr himself addressed the court, not, he said, "to
remedy any omission of his counsel, who had done
great justice to the subject," but "to repel some
observations of a personal nature." Treason meant
deeds, yet he was being persecuted on "mere conjecture."
The whole country had been unjustly
aroused against him. Wilkinson had frightened the
President, and Jefferson, in turn, had alarmed the
people.</p>

<p>Had he acted like a guilty man, he asked? Briefly
and modestly he told of his conduct before the courts
and grand juries in Kentucky and Mississippi, and
the result of those investigations. The people among
whom he journeyed saw nothing hostile or treasonable
in his expedition.</p>

<p>His "flight"? That had occurred only when he
was denied the protection of the laws and when
armed men, under illegal orders of an autocratic
military authority, were seeking to seize him violently.
Then, and only then, acting upon the advice
of friends and upon his own judgment, had he
"abandoned a country where the laws ceased to be
the sovereign power." Why had the guards who
brought him from Alabama to Richmond "avoided
every magistrate on the way"? Why had he been
refused the use of pen, ink, and paper&mdash;denied
even the privilege of writing to his daughter? It
was true that when, in South Carolina, the soldiers
chanced upon three civilians, he did indeed "demand
the interposition of the civil authority." Was
that criminal? Was it not his right to seek to be delivered
from "military despotism, from the tyranny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
of a military escort," and to be subjected only to
"the operation of the laws of his country"?<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 1, Marshall delivered the
second of that series of opinions which established
the boundaries of the American law of treason and
rendered the trial of Aaron Burr as notable for the
number and the importance of decisions made from
the bench during the progress of it, as it was famous
among legal duels in the learning, power, and eloquence
of counsel, in the influences brought to bear
upon court and jury, and in the dramatic setting
and the picturesque incidents of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Marshall had carefully written his opinion. At
the close of court on the preceding day, he had announced
that he would do this in order "to prevent
any misrepresentations of expressions that might
fall on him." He had also assured Hay that, in case
he decided to commit Burr, the District Attorney
should be heard at any length he desired on the
question of bail.</p>

<p>Thus, at the very beginning, Marshall showed
that patience, consideration, and prudence so characteristic
of him, and so indispensable to the conduct
of this trial, if dangerous collisions with the
prevailing mob spirit were to be avoided. He had in
mind, too, the haughty and peremptory conduct of
Chase, Addison, and other judges which had given
Jefferson his excuse for attacking the Judiciary, and
which had all but placed that branch of the Government
in the absolute control of that great practical
genius of political manipulation. By the gentleness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
of his voice and manner, Marshall lessened the excuse
which Jefferson was eagerly seeking in order
again to inflame the passions of the people against
the Judiciary.</p>

<p>Proof strong enough to convict "on a trial in
chief," or even to convince the judge himself of
Burr's guilt, was not, said Marshall, necessary to
justify the court in holding him for the action of
the grand jury; but there must be enough testimony
"to furnish good reason to believe" that Burr had
actually committed the crimes with which he stood
charged.</p>

<p>Marshall quoted Blackstone to the effect that a
prisoner could be discharged only when it appeared
that the suspicion against him was "wholly groundless,"
but this did not mean that "the hand of malignity
may grasp any individual against whom its
hate may be directed or whom it may capriciously
seize, charge him with some secret crime and put
him on the proof of his innocence."</p>

<p>Precisely that "hand of malignity," however,
Burr was feeling by orders of Jefferson. The partisans
of the President instantly took alarm at
this passage of Marshall's opinion. Here was this
insolent Federalist Chief Justice, at the very outset
of the investigation, presuming to reflect upon their
idol. Such was the indignant comment that ran
among the Republicans who packed the hall; and
reflect upon the President, Marshall certainly did,
and intended to do.</p>

<p>The softly spoken but biting words of the Chief
Justice were unnecessary to the decision of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
question before him; they accurately described the
conduct of the Administration, and they could
have been uttered only as a rebuke to Jefferson or
as an attempt to cool the public rage that the President
had aroused. Perhaps both motives inspired
Marshall's pen when he wrote that statesmanlike
sentence.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, said Marshall, probable cause to
suspect Burr guilty of an attempt to attack the
Spanish possessions appeared from Wilkinson's affidavit;
but the charge of treason was quite another
matter. "As this is the most atrocious offence which
can be committed against the political body, so it is
the charge which is most capable of being employed
as the instrument of those malignant and vindictive
passions which may rage in the bosoms of contending
parties struggling for power." Treason is the
only crime specifically mentioned in the Constitution&mdash;the
definition of all others is left to Congress.
But the Constitution itself carefully and plainly describes
treason and prescribes just how it must be
proved.</p>

<p>Did the testimony show probable grounds for believing
that Burr had committed treason? Marshall
analyzed the affidavits of Eaton and Wilkinson,
which constituted all of the "evidence" against
Burr; and although the whole matter had been ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>amined
by the Supreme Court in the case of Bollmann
and Swartwout, he nevertheless went over the
same ground again. No impatience, no hasty or
autocratic action, no rudeness of manner, no harshness
of speech on his part should give politicians a
weapon with which once more to strike at judges
and courts.</p>

<p>Where, asked Marshall, was the evidence that
Burr had assembled an army to levy war on the
United States? Not before the court, certainly.
Mere "suspicion" was not to be ignored when means
of proving the suspected facts were not yet secured;
but where the truth could easily have been established,
if it existed, and yet no proof of it had been
brought forward, everybody "must admit that the
ministers of justice at least ought not officially to
entertain" unsupported conjectures or assertions.</p>

<p>"The fact to be proved ... is an act of public notoriety.
It must exist in the view of the world, or it
cannot exist at all.... Months have elapsed since the
fact did occur, if it ever occurred. More than five
weeks have elapsed since the ... supreme court has
declared the necessity of proving the fact, if it exists.
Why is it not proved?" It is, said Marshall, the
duty of the Executive Department to prosecute
crimes. "It would be easy" for the Government
"to procure affidavits" that Burr had assembled
troops five months ago. Certainly the court "ought
not to believe that there had been any remissness"
on the part of the Administration; and since no
evidence had been presented that Burr had gathered
soldiers, "the suspicion, which in the first instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
might have been created, ought not to be continued,
unless this want of proof can be in some manner
accounted for."</p>

<p>Marshall would, therefore, commit Burr for high
misdemeanor, but not for treason, and must, of consequence,
admit the prisoner to bail. The Chief
Justice suggested the sum of ten thousand dollars
as being "about right."<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> Hay protested that the
amount was too small. Burr "is here among strangers,"
replied Wickham. He has fewer acquaintances
in Richmond than anywhere in the country.
To be sure, two humane men had saved the prisoner
"from the horrors of the dungeon" when he arrived;
but the first bail was only for two days, while
the present bail was for an indefinite period. "Besides,"
asserted Wickham, "I have heard several
gentlemen of great respectability, who did not doubt
that colonel Burr would keep his recognisance, express
an unwillingness to appear as bail for him, lest
it might be supposed they were enemies to their
country."<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>Thus were cleverly brought into public and official
view the conditions under which this trial, so
vital to American liberty, was to be held. Burr was
a "traitor," asserted Jefferson. "Burr a traitor!"
echoed the general voice. That all who befriended
Burr were, therefore, also "traitors at heart," was
the conclusion of popular logic. Who dared brave
the wrath of that blind and merciless god, Public
Prejudice? From the very beginning the prosecution
invoked the power of this avenging and re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>morseless
deity, while the defense sought to break
that despotic spell and arouse the spirit of opposition
to the tyranny of it. These facts explain the
legal strategy of the famous controversy&mdash;a controversy
that continued throughout the sweltering
months of the summer and far into the autumn
of 1807.</p>

<p>Hay declared that he had been "well informed
that Colonel Burr could give bail in the sum of
one hundred thousand dollars." Gravely Burr answered
that there was serious doubt whether bail in
any sum could be procured; "gentlemen are unwilling
to expose themselves to animadversions" which
would be the result of their giving bail for him. He
averred that he had no financial resources. "It is
pretty well known that the government has ordered
my property seized, and that the order has been executed."
He had thus lost "upwards of forty thousand
dollars," and his "credit had consequently
been much impaired."<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, unmoved by the appeals of either side,
fixed the bail at ten thousand dollars and adjourned
court until three o'clock to enable Burr to procure
sureties for that amount. At the appointed hour the
prisoner came into court with five men of property
who gave their bond for his appearance at the next
term of the United States Circuit Court, to be held
at Richmond on May 22.</p>

<p>For three precious weeks at least Aaron Burr was
free. He made the best of his time, although he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
could do little more than perfect the plans for his
defense. His adored Theodosia was in alternate rage
and despair, and Burr strove to cheer and steady her
as best he might. Some of "your letters," he writes,
"indicate a sort of stupor"; in others "you rise into
phrenzy." He bids her come "back to reason....
Such things happen in all democratic governments."
Consider the "vindictive and unrelenting persecution"
of men of "virtue, ... independence and ... talents
in Greece and Rome." Let Theodosia "amuse"
herself by collecting instances of the kind and writing
an essay on the subject "with reflections, comments
and applications." The perusal of it, he says,
will give him "great pleasure" if he gets it by the
time court opens in May.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p>Burr learned the names of those who were to compose
the grand jury that was to investigate his misdeeds.
Among them were "twenty democrats and
four federalists," he informs his daughter. One of
"the former is W. C. Nicholas my vindictive ...
personal enemy&mdash;the most so that could be found
in this state. The most indefatigable industry is
used by the agents of government, and they have
money at command without stint. If I were possessed
of the same means, I could not only foil
the prosecutors, but render them ridiculous and infamous.
The democratic papers teem with abuse of
me and my counsel, and even against the chief justice.
Nothing is left undone or unsaid which can
tend to prejudice the public mind, and produce a
conviction without evidence. The machinations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
this description which were used against Moreau in
France were treated in this country with indignation.
They are practiced against me in a still more impudent
degree, not only with impunity, but with
applause; and the authors and abettors suppose,
with reason, that they are acquiring favour with the
administration."<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

<p>Every word of this was true. The Republican
press blazed with denunciation of "the traitor."
The people, who had been led to believe that the
destruction of their "liberties" had been the object
at which Burr ultimately aimed, were intent on the
death of their would-be despoiler. Republican politicians
were nervously apprehensive lest, through
Marshall's application of the law, Burr might escape
and the Administration and the entire Republican
Party thereby be convicted of persecuting an innocent
man. They feared, even more, the effect on
their political fortunes of being made ridiculous.</p>

<p>Giles was characteristically alert to the danger.
Soon after Marshall had declined to commit Burr
for treason and had released him under bail to appear
on the charge of misdemeanor only, the Republican
leader of the Senate, then in Virginia, wrote
Jefferson of the situation.</p>

<p>The preliminary hearing of Burr had, Giles stated,
greatly excited the people of Virginia and probably
would "have the same effect in all parts of the
United States." He urged the President to take
"all measures necessary for effecting ... a full and
fair judicial investigation." The enemies of the Ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>ministration
had gone so far as to "suggest doubts"
as to the "measures heretofore pursued in relation
to Burr," and had dared to "intimate that the executive
are not possessed of evidence to justify
those measures"&mdash;or, if there was such evidence,
that the prosecution had been "extremely delinquent
in not producing it at the examination." Nay, more!
"It is even said that General Wilkinson will not be
ordered to attend the trial." That would never do;
the absence of that militant patriot "would implicate
the character of the administration, more than
they can be apprised of."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p>But Jefferson was sufficiently alarmed without
any sounding of the tocsin by his Senatorial agent.
"He had so frightened the country ... that to escape
being overwhelmed by ridicule, he must get his prisoner
convicted of the fell designs which he had publically
attributed to him."<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> It is true that Jefferson
did not believe Burr had committed treason;<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> but he
had formally declared to Congress and the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
that Burr's "guilt is placed beyond question," and,
at any cost, he must now make good that charge.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>

<p>From the moment that he received the news of
Marshall's decision to hold Burr for misdemeanor
and to accept bail upon that charge, the prosecution
of his former associate became Jefferson's ruling
thought and purpose. It occupied his mind even
more than the Nation's foreign affairs, which were
then in the most dangerous state.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> Champion
though he was of equal rights for all men, yet any
opposition to his personal or political desires or
interests appeared to madden him.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> A personal
antagonism, once formed, became with Thomas
Jefferson a public policy.</p>

<p>He could see neither merit nor honesty in any act
or word that appeared to him to favor Burr. Anybody
who intimated doubt of his guilt did so, in
Jefferson's opinion, for partisan or equally unworthy
reasons. "The fact is that the Federalists make
Burr's cause their own, and exert their whole influence
to shield him," he asserted two days after
Marshall had admitted Burr to bail.<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> His hatred
of the National Judiciary was rekindled if, indeed,
its fires ever had died down. "It is unfortunate
that federalism is still predominant in our judiciary
department, which is consequently in opposition to
the legislative &amp; Executive branches &amp; is able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
baffle their measures often," he averred at the same
time, and with reference to Marshall's rulings thus
far in the Burr case.</p>

<p>He pours out his feelings with true Jeffersonian
bitterness and passion in his answer to Giles's letter.
No wonder, he writes, that "anxiety and doubt"
had arisen "in the public mind in the present defective
state of the proof." This tendency had "been
sedulously encouraged by the tricks of the judges to
force trials before it is possible to collect the evidence
dispersed through a line of two thousand miles
from Maine to Orleans."</p>

<p>The Federalists too were helping Burr! These
miscreants were "mortified only that he did not
separate the Union and overturn the government."
The truth was, declares Jefferson, that the Federalists
would have joined Burr in order to establish
"their favorite monarchy" and rid themselves of
"this hated republic," if only the traitor had had
"a little dawn of success." Consider the inconsistent
attitude of these Federalists. Their first "complaint
was the supine inattention of the administration to a
treason stalking through the land in the open light
of day; the present one, that they [the Administration]
have crushed it before it was ripe for execution,
so that no overt acts can be proved."</p>

<p>Jefferson confides to Giles that the Government
may not be able to establish the commission of
overt acts; in fact, he says, "we do not know of a
certainty yet what will be proved." But the Administration
is already doing its very best: "We have
set on foot an inquiry through the whole of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
country which has been the scene of these transactions
to be able to prove to the courts, if they will
give time, or to the public by way of communication
to Congress, what the real facts have been"&mdash;this
three months after Jefferson had asserted, in
his Special Message on the conspiracy, that Burr's
"guilt is placed beyond question."</p>

<p>In this universal quest for "the facts," the Government
had no help from the National courts, complains
the President: "Aided by no process or facilities
from Federal Courts,<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> but frowned on by their
new-born zeal for the liberty of those whom we
would not permit to overthrow the liberties of their
country, we can expect no revealments from the
accomplices of the chief offender." But witnesses
would be produced who would "satisfy the world if
not the judges" of Burr's treason. Jefferson enumerates
the "overt acts" which the Administration
expected to prove.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p>Marshall, of course, stood in the way, for it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
plain that "the evidence cannot be collected under
4 months, probably 5." Jefferson had directed his
Attorney-General, "unofficially," but "expressly,"
to "inform the Chief Justice of this." With what
result? "Mr. Marshall says, 'more than 5 weeks
have elapsed since the opinion of the Supreme Court
has declared the necessity of proving the overt
acts if they exist. Why are they not proved?' In
what terms of decency," growls Jefferson, "can we
speak of this? As if an express could go to Natchez
or the mouth of the Cumberland and return in 5
weeks, to do which has never taken less than
twelve."</p>

<p>Jefferson cannot sufficiently criticize Marshall's
opinion: "If, in Nov. or Dec. last, a body of troops
had assembled on the Ohio, it is impossible to suppose
the affidavits establishing the fact could not
have been obtained by the last of March," he quotes
from Marshall's ruling. "I ask the judge where
they [the affidavits] should have been lodged? At
Frankfort? at Cincinnati? at Nashville? St. Louis?...
New Orleans?... Where? At Richmond he certainly
meant, or meant only to throw dust in the
eyes of his audience."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p>As his pen flew over the burning page, Jefferson's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
anger grew. Marshall's love of monarchy was at the
bottom of his decision: "All the principles of law
are to be perverted which would bear on the favorite
offenders who endeavor to overrun this odious
Republic."</p>

<p>Marshall's refinements as to proof required to establish
probable cause to believe Burr guilty, particularly
irritated Jefferson. "As to the overt acts,
were not the bundle of letters of information in Mr.
Rodney's hands, the letters and facts published in
the local newspapers, Burr's flight, &amp; the universal belief
or rumor of his guilt, probable ground for presuming
the facts ... so as to put him on trial? Is
there a candid man in the U S who does not believe
some one, if not all, of these overt acts to have
taken place?"</p>

<p>How dare Marshall require legal evidence when
"letters, newspapers and rumors" condemned Burr!
How dare he, as a judge, not heed "the universal
belief," especially when that general public opinion
had been crystallized by Jefferson himself!</p>

<p>That Marshall was influenced by politics and was
of a kidney with the whole breed of National judges
up to that time, Jefferson had not the slightest
doubt. "If there ever had been an instance in this
or the preceding administrations, of federal judges
so applying principles of law as to condemn a federal
or acquit a republican offender, I should have judged
them in the present case with more charity."</p>

<p>But the conduct of the Chief Justice will be the
final outrage which will compel a great reform.
"The nation will judge both the offender &amp; judges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
for themselves ... the people ... will see ... &amp; amend
the error in our Constitution, which makes any
branch independent of the nation.... One of the
great co-ordinate branches of the government, setting
itself in opposition to the other two, and to the
common sense of the nation, proclaims impunity to
that class of offenders which endeavors to overturn
the Constitution, and are themselves protected in
it by the Constitution itself; for impeachment is
a farce which will not be tried again."</p>

<p>Thus Jefferson extracts some comfort from Marshall's
refusal to obey popular clamor and condemn
on "rumor." If Marshall's "protection of Burr produces
this amendment,<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> it will do more good than
his condemnation would have done. Against Burr,
personally," audaciously adds Jefferson, "I never
had one hostile sentiment."<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of the President's mind when
he learned of Marshall's ruling on the Government's
motion to commit Burr to jail upon the charges of
treason and high misdemeanor. Jefferson felt that
he himself was on trial; he knew that he must make
good his charges or suffer a decline in the popularity
which he prized above all else in life. He proposed
that, at the very least, the public should be on
his side, and he resolved to exert the utmost efforts
of the National Government to bend Marshall to
his will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the President of the United States became
the leading counsel in the prosecution of Aaron
Burr, as well as the director-general of a propaganda
planned to confirm public opinion of Burr's treason,
and to discredit Marshall should his decisions from
the bench result in the prisoner's escape from the
gallows.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> Jefferson ordered his Attorney-General,
C&aelig;sar A. Rodney, to direct justices of the peace
throughout the country to examine everybody supposed
to have any knowledge of Burr, his plans,
movements, or conversations. Long lists of questions,
designed to elicit replies that would convict
Burr, were sent to these officials on printed forms.
A vast drag-net was spread over almost the whole
of the United States and drawn swiftly and remorselessly
to Washington.</p>

<p>The programme for the prosecution became the
subject of anxious Cabinet meetings, and the resources
of every department of the Executive branch
of the Government were employed to overwhelm the
accused man. Jefferson directed Madison as Secretary
of State "to take the necessary measures,"
including the advance of money for their expenses,
to bring to Richmond witnesses "from great distances."</p>

<p>Five thousand dollars, in a single warrant, was
given to the Attorney-General for use in supporting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
the Administration's case.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> The total amount of the
public money expended by Jefferson's orders to secure
Burr's conviction was $11,721.11, not a dollar
of which had been appropriated for that purpose.
"All lawful expenses in the prosecution of Burr were
audited, and paid in full," under a law which provided
for the conduct of criminal cases; the sums
spent by direction of the President were in addition
to the money dispensed by authority of that
law.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a></p>

<p>When Bollmann had been brought to Washington,
he had read with rage and amazement the newspaper
accounts that Burr had led two thousand armed
men in a violent and treasonable attack upon the
United States. Accordingly, after Marshall released
him from imprisonment, he hastened to Jefferson
and tried to correct what he declared to be "false
impressions" concerning Burr's treason. Bollmann
also wished to convince the President that war with
Spain was desirable, and to get his support of Burr's
expedition. Jefferson, having taken the precaution
to have the Secretary of State present at the interview,
listened with apparent sympathy. The following
day he requested Bollmann to write out and
deliver to him his verbal statements, "Thomas
Jefferson giving him <i>his word of honour</i> that they
should never be used against himself [Bollmann]
and <i>that the paper shall never go out of his</i> [Jefferson's]
<i>hand</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>The confiding Bollmann did as the President requested,
his whole paper going "to disprove treason,
and to show the expediency of war." Because of unfamiliarity
with the English language "one or two
expressions" may have been "improperly used."<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
Bollmann's statement Jefferson now transmitted to
the District Attorney at Richmond, in order, said
the President, "that you may know how to examine
him and draw everything from him."</p>

<p>Jefferson ordered Hay to show the paper only to
his associate counsel; but, if Bollmann "should prevaricate,"
the President adds, "ask him whether he
did not say so and so to Mr. Madison and myself."
The President assures Hay that "in order to let
him [Bollmann] see that his prevarication will be
marked, Mr. Madison will forward [Hay] a pardon
for him, which we mean should be delivered previously."
Jefferson fears that Bollmann may not
appear as a witness and directs Hay to "take effectual
measures to have him immediately taken into
custody."</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Three months earlier, Wilkinson
had suggested to Jefferson the base expedient
of offering pardons to Burr's associates, in order to
induce them to betray him and thus make certain
his conviction.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> Apparently this crafty and sinister
advice now recurred to Jefferson's mind&mdash;at least
he followed it. He enclosed a sheaf of pardons and
directed Hay to fill them out "at [his] discretion, if
[he] should find a defect of evidence, &amp; believe that
this would supply it, by avoiding to give them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
the gross offenders, unless it be visible that the principal
will otherwise escape."<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>In the same letter Jefferson also sent to Hay the
affidavit of one Jacob Dunbaugh, containing a mass
of bizarre falsehoods, as was made plain during
the trial. Dunbaugh was a sergeant who had been
arrested for desertion and had been pardoned by
Wilkinson on condition that he would give suitable
testimony against Burr. "If," continues Jefferson,
"General Wilkinson gets on in time,<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> I expect he
will bring Dunbaugh with him. At any rate it
[Dunbaugh's affidavit] may be a ground for an arrest
&amp; committment for treason."</p>

<p>Vividly alive to the forces at work to doom him,
Burr nevertheless was not dismayed. As a part of
his preparation for defense he exercised on all whom
he met the full power of his wonderful charm; and
if ever a human being needed friends, Aaron Burr
needed them in the Virginia Capital. As usual, most
of those who conversed with him and looked into his
deep, calm eyes became his partisans. Gradually,
a circle of men and women of the leading families
of Richmond gathered about him, supporting and
comforting him throughout his desperate ordeal.</p>

<p>Burr's attorneys were no longer merely his
counsel performing their professional duty; even
before the preliminary hearing was over, they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
become his personal friends and ardent champions.
They were ready and eager to go into court and
fight for their client with that aggressiveness and
enthusiasm which comes only from affection for a
man and a faith in his cause. Every one of them
not only had developed a great fondness for Burr,
but earnestly believed that his enterprise was praise-worthy
rather than treasonable.</p>

<p>One of them, John Wickham, was a commanding
figure in the society of Richmond, as well as the
leader of the Virginia bar at that time.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> He was a
close friend of Marshall and lived in an imposing
house near him. It was to Wickham that Marshall
had left the conduct of his cases in court when he
went to France on the X. Y. Z. mission.</p>

<p>Dinners were then the principal form of social
intercourse in Richmond, and were constantly given.
The more prominent lawyers were particularly devoted
to this pleasing method of cheer and relaxation.
This custom kept the brilliant bar of Richmond
sweet and wholesome, and nourished among
its members a mutual regard, while discouraging resentments
and animosities. Much of that courtesy
and deference shown to one another by the lawyers
of that city, even in the most spirited encounters in
court, was due to that esteem and fellowship which
their practice of dining together created.</p>

<p>Of the dispensers of such hospitality, Marshall
and Wickham were the most notable and popular.
The "lawyer dinners" given by Marshall were
famous; and the tradition of them still casts a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
warm and exhilarating glow. The dinners, too, of
John Wickham were quite as alluring. The food was
as plentiful and as well prepared, the wines as varied,
select, and of as ancient vintage, the brandy as old
and "sound," the juleps as fragrant and seductive;
and the wit was as sparkling, the table talk as informing,
the good humor as heartening. Nobody
ever thought of declining an invitation to the house
of John Wickham.</p>

<p>All these circumstances combined to create a situation
for which Marshall was promptly denounced
with that thoughtlessness and passion so characteristic
of partisanship&mdash;a situation that has furnished
a handle for malignant criticism of him to this day.
During the interval between the preliminary hearing
and the convening of court in May, Wickham
gave one of his frequent and much-desired dinners.
As a matter of course, Wickham's intimate friend
and next-door neighbor was present&mdash;no dinner in
Richmond ever was complete without the gentle-mannered,
laughter-loving John Marshall, with his
gift for making everybody happy and at ease. But
Aaron Burr was also a guest.</p>

<p>Aaron Burr, "the traitor," held to make answer
to charges for his infamous crimes, and John Marshall,
the judge before whom the miscreant was to be
tried, dining together! And at the house of Burr's
chief counsel! Here was an event more valuable
to the prosecution than any evidence or argument,
in the effect it would have, if rightly employed, on
public opinion, before which Burr had been and was
arraigned far more than before the court of justice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>Full use was made of the incident. The Republican
organ, the Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>, promptly exposed
and denounced it. This was done by means of
two letters signed "A Stranger from the Country,"
who "never had any, the least confidence in the
political principles of the chief justice"&mdash;none in
"that noble candor" and "those splendid ... even
god-like talents which many of all parties ascribe to
him." Base as in reality he was, Marshall might have
"spared his country" the "wanton insult" of having
"feasted at the same convivial board with Aaron
Burr." What excuse was there for "conduct so
grossly indecent"? To what motive should Marshall's
action be ascribed? "Is this charity, hypocracy,
or federalism?" Doubtless he "was not actuated
by any corrupt motive," and "was unapprised
of the invitation of B."<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> However, the fact is, that
the judge, the accused, and his attorney, were fellow
guests at this "treason rejoicing dinner."<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the great opinions of John Marshall, delivered
during the trial of Aaron Burr, were condemned
before they were rendered or even formed. With
that lack of consideration which even democracies
sometimes display, the facts were not taken into
account. That Marshall never knew, until he was
among them, who his fellow guests were to be; that
Wickham's dinner, except in the presence of Burr,
differed in no respect from those constantly given in
Richmond; that Marshall, having arrived, could do
nothing except to leave and thus make the situation
worse;&mdash;none of these simple and obvious facts
seemed to have occurred to the eager critics of the
Chief Justice.</p>

<p>That Marshall was keenly aware of his predicament
there can be no doubt. He was too good a
politician and understood too well public whimsies
and the devices by which they are manipulated, not
to see the consequences of the innocent but unfortunate
evening at Wickham's house. But he did not
explain; he uttered not a syllable of apology. With
good-natured contempt for the maneuvers of the
politicians and the rage of the public, yet carefully
and coolly weighing every element of the situation,
John Marshall, when the appointed day of May
came around, was ready to take his seat upon the
bench and to conduct the historic trial of Aaron
Burr with that kindly forbearance which never deserted
him, that canny understanding of men and
motives which served him better than learning,
and that placid fortitude that could not be shaken.</p>

Three days before he made oath to the truth of this story, Eaton's
claim against the Government was referred to a committee of the
House (see <i>Annals</i>, 9th Cong. 2d Sess. 383), and within a month
from the time the historic affidavit was made, a bill was passed, without
debate, "authorizing the settlement of the accounts between the
United States and William Eaton."
</p><p>
John Randolph was suspicious: "He believed the bill had passed by
surprise. It was not so much a bill to settle the accounts of William
Eaton, as to rip up the settled forms of the Treasury, and to transfer
the accountable duties of the Treasury to the Department of State. It
would be a stain upon the Statute Book." (<i>Ib.</i> 622.)
</p><p>
The very next week after the passage of this measure, Eaton received
ten thousand dollars from the Government. (See testimony of

In his translation Wilkinson carefully omitted the first sentence of
Burr's dispatch: "Yours, post-marked 13th of May, is received."

the following disclosures: "Colonel Burr, with the support of a
powerful association, extending from New York to New Orleans, was
levying an armed body of seven thousand men from the state of New
York and the Western states and Territories" to invade Mexico which
"would be revolutionized, where the people were ready to join them."
</p><p>
"There would be some seizing, he supposed at New Orleans"; he
"knew full well" that "there were several millions of dollars in the
bank of this place," but that Burr's party only "meant to borrow and
would return it&mdash;they must equip themselves at New Orleans, etc.,
etc." (<i>Annals</i>, 9th Cong. 2d Sess. 1014-15.)
</p><p>
Swartwout made oath that he told Wilkinson nothing of the kind.
The high character which this young man then bore, together with
the firm impression of truthfulness he made on everybody at that
time and during the distracting months that followed, would seem to
suggest the conclusion that Wilkinson's story was only another of the
brood of falsehoods of which that fecund liar was so prolific.</p></div>

occurred, Marshall did not know, when he accepted Wickham's invitation,
that Burr was to be a guest, but heard of that fact before
the dinner. His wife, thereupon, advised him not to go, but, out of
regard for Wickham, he attended. (Thayer: <i>John Marshall</i>, 80-81.)
</p><p>
This tale is almost certainly a myth. Professor Thayer, to whom it
was told by an unnamed descendant of Marshall, indicates plainly
that he had little faith in it.
</p><p>
The facts that, at the time, even the <i>Enquirer</i> acquitted Marshall
of any knowledge that Burr was to be present; that the prudence
of the Chief Justice was admitted by his bitterest enemies; that so
gross an indiscretion would have been obvious to the most reckless;
that Marshall, of all men, would not have embarrassed himself in
such fashion, particularly at a time when public suspicion was so
keen and excitement so intense&mdash;render it most improbable that he
knew that Burr was to be at the Wickham dinner.</p></div>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION VERSUS COURT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In substance Jefferson said that if Marshall should suffer Burr to escape,
Marshall himself should be removed from office. (Henry Adams.)</p>

<p>It becomes our duty to lay the evidence before the public. Go into any expense
necessary for this purpose. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>The President has let slip the dogs of war, the hell-hounds of persecution, to
hunt down my friend. (Luther Martin.)</p>

<p>If you cannot exorcise the demon of prejudice, you can chain him down to

<p>On May 22, 1807, the hall of the House of Delegates
at Richmond was densely crowded long before the
hour of half-past twelve, when John Marshall took
his seat upon the bench and opened court. So occupied
was every foot of space that it was with difficulty
that a passage was opened through which the
tall, awkwardly moving, and negligently clad Chief
Justice could make his way. By Marshall's side sat
Cyrus Griffin, Judge of the District Court, who
throughout the proceedings was negligible.</p>

<p>The closely packed spectators accurately portrayed
the dress, manners, and trend of thought of
the American people of that period. Gentlemen in
elegant attire&mdash;hair powdered and queues tied in
silk, knee breeches and silver buckles, long rich cloth
coats cut half away at the waist, ruffled shirts and
high stocks&mdash;were conspicuous against the background
of the majority of the auditors, whose
apparel, however, was no less picturesque.</p>

<p>This audience was largely made up of men from
the smaller plantations, men from the mountains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
men from the backwoods, men from the frontiers.
Red woolen shirts; rough homespun or corduroy
trousers, held up by "galluses"; fringed deerskin
coats and "leggings" of the same material kept in
place by leather belts; hair sometimes tied by strings
in uncouth queues, but more often hanging long and
unconfined&mdash;in such garb appeared the greater
part of the attendance at the trial of Aaron Burr.
In forty years there had been but little change in
the general appearance of Virginians<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> except that
fewer wore the old dignified and becoming attire of
well-dressed men.</p>

<p>Nearly all of them were Republicans, plain men,
devoted to Jefferson as the exponent of democracy
and the heaven-sent leader of the people. Among
these Jeffersonians, however, were several who, quite
as much as the stiffest Federalists, prided themselves
upon membership in the "upper classes."</p>

<p>Nearly all of the Republicans present, whether of
the commonalty or the gentry, were against Aaron
Burr. Scattered here and there were a few Federalists&mdash;men
who were convinced that democracy
meant the ruin of the Republic, and who profoundly
believed that Jefferson was nothing more than an
intriguing, malicious demagogue&mdash;most of whom
looked upon Burr with an indulgent eye. So did
an occasional Republican, as now and then a lone
Federalist denounced Burr's villainy.</p>

<p>The good-sized square boxes filled with sand that
were placed at infrequent intervals upon the floor
of the improvised court-room were too few to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
the tobacco juice that filled the mouths of most of
the spectators before it was squirted freely upon the
floor and wall. Those who did not chew the weed
either smoked big cigars and fat pipes or contented
themselves with taking snuff.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> Upon recess or adjournment
of court, all, regularly and without loss of
time, repaired to the nearest saloons or taverns and
strengthened themselves, with generous draughts of
whiskey or brandy, taken "straight," for a firmer,
clearer grasp of the points made by counsel.</p>

<p>Never, in its history, had Richmond been so
crowded with strangers. Nearly five thousand
people now dwelt in the Virginia Capital, the site of
which was still "untamed and broken" by "inaccessible
heights and deep ravines."<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Thousands of
visitors had come from all over the country to witness
the prosecution of that fallen angel whose dark
deeds, they had been made to believe, had been in
a fair way to destroy the Nation. The inns could
shelter but an insignificant fraction of them, and few
were the private houses that did not take in men
whom the taverns could not accommodate. Hundreds
brought covered wagons or tents and camped under
the trees or on the river-banks near the city. Correspondents
of the press of the larger cities were present,
among them the youthful<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> Washington Irving, who
wrote one or two articles for a New York paper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>
<p>In the concourse thus drawn to Richmond, few
there were who were not certain that Burr had
planned and attempted to assassinate Jefferson,
overthrow the Government, shatter the Nation, and
destroy American "liberty"; and so vocal and belligerent
was this patriotic majority that men who at
first held opinions contrary to the prevailing sentiment,
or who entertained doubts of Burr's guilt,
kept discreetly silent. So aggressively hostile was
public feeling that, weeks later, when the bearing
and manners of Burr, and the devotion, skill, and
boldness of his counsel had softened popular asperity,
Marshall declared that, even then, "it would be
difficult or dangerous for a jury to venture to acquit
Burr, however innocent they might think him."<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a>
The prosecution of Aaron Burr occurred when a
tempest of popular prejudice and intolerance was
blowing its hardest.</p>

<p>The provision concerning treason had been written
into the American Constitution "to protect the
people against that horrible and dangerous doctrine
of constructive treason which had stained the English
records with blood and filled the English valleys
with innocent graves."<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>The punishment for treason in all countries had
been brutal and savage in the extreme. In Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>land,
that crime had not perhaps been treated with
such severity as elsewhere. Yet, even in England,
so harsh had been the rulings of the courts against
those charged with treason, so inhuman the execution
of judgments upon persons found guilty under
these rulings, so slight the pretexts that sent innocent
men and women to their death,<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> that the
framers of our fundamental law had been careful
to define treason with utmost clearness, and to declare
that proof of it could only be made by two
witnesses to the same overt act or by confession of
the accused in open court.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>That was one subject upon which the quarreling
members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787
had been in accord, and their solution of the question
had been the one and the only provision of
which no complaint had been made during the struggle
over ratification.</p>

<p>Every member of that Convention&mdash;every officer
and soldier of the Revolution from Washington down
to private, every man or woman who had given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
succor or supplies to a member of the patriot army,
everybody who had advocated American independence&mdash;all
such persons could have been prosecuted
and might have been convicted as "traitors"
under the British law of constructive treason.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a>
"None," said Justice James Iredell in 1792, "can
so highly ... prize these provisions [of the Constitution]
as those who are best acquainted with the
abuses which have been practised in other countries
in prosecutions for this offence.... We ... hope that
the page of American history will never be stained
with prosecutions for treason, begun without cause,
conducted without decency, and ending in iniquitous
convictions, without the slightest feelings of
remorse."<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>Yet, six years later, Iredell avowed his belief in the
doctrine of constructive treason.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> And in less than
seventeen years from the time our National Government
was established, the reasons for writing
into the Constitution the rigid provision concerning
treason were forgotten by the now thoroughly partisanized
multitude, if, indeed, the people ever knew
those reasons.</p>

<p>Moreover, every National judge who had passed
upon the subject, with the exception of John Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>shall,
had asserted the British doctrine of constructive
treason. Most of the small number who realized
the cause and real meaning of the American Constitutional
provision as to treason were overawed by
the public frenzy; and brave indeed was he who
defied the popular passion of the hour or questioned
the opinion of Thomas Jefferson, then at the summit
of his popularity.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>One such dauntless man, however, there was
among the surging throng that filled the Capitol
Square at Richmond after the adjournment of court
on May 22, and he was a vigorous Republican, too.
"A tall, lank, uncouth-looking personage, with long
locks of hair hanging over his face, and a queue
down his back tied in an eel-skin, his dress singular,
his manners and deportment that of a rough backwoodsman,"<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a>
mounted the steps of a corner grocery
and harangued the glowering assemblage that
gathered in front of him.<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> His daring, and an unmistakable
air that advertised danger to any who
disputed him, prevented that violent interruption
certain to have been visited upon one less bold and
formidable. He praised Burr as a brave man and a
patriot who would have led Americans against the
hated Spanish; he denounced Jefferson as a persecutor
who sought the ruin of one he hated. Thus
Andrew Jackson of Tennessee braved and cowed
the hostile mob that was demanding and impatiently
awaiting the condemnation and execution of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
one who, for the moment, had been made the object
of the country's execration.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>

<p>Jackson had recovered from his brief distrust of
Burr, and the reaction had carried his tempestuous
nature into extreme championship of his friend.
"I am more convinced than ever," he wrote during
the trial, "that treason was never intended by
Burr."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> Throughout the extended and acrimonious
contest, Jackson's conviction grew stronger that Burr
was a wronged man, hounded by betrayers, and the
victim of a political conspiracy to take his life and
destroy his reputation. And Jackson firmly believed
that the leader of this cabal was Thomas Jefferson.
"I am sorry to say," he wrote, "that this thing [the
Burr trial] has ... assumed the shape of a political
persecution."<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>The Administration retaliated by branding Andrew
Jackson a "malcontent"; and Madison, because
of Jackson's attitude, prevented as long as
possible the military advancement of the refractory
Tennesseean during the War of 1812.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> On the other
hand, Burr never ceased to be grateful to his frontiersman
adherent, and years later was one of those
who set in motion the forces which made Andrew
Jackson President of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>Nor was Jackson the only Republican who considered
Jefferson as the contriving and energizing
hand of the scheme to convict Burr. Almost riotous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
were the efforts to get into the hall where the trial
was held, though it was situated on a steep hill and
"the ascent to the building was painfully laborious."<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>
Old and eminent lawyers of Richmond could not
reach the bar of the court, so dense was the throng.</p>

<p>One youthful attorney, tall and powerful, "the
most magnificent youth in Virginia," determined to
witness the proceedings, shouldered his way within
and "stood on the massive lock of the great door"
of the chamber.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> Thus Winfield Scott got his first
view of that striking scene, and beheld the man
whose plans to invade Mexico he himself, more
than a generation afterward, was to carry out as
Commander of the American Army. Scott, there
and then, arrived at conclusions which a lifetime of
thought and experiences confirmed. "It was President
Jefferson who directed and animated the prosecution,"
he declares in his "Memoirs." Scott records
the political alignment that resulted: "Hence every
Republican clamored for execution. Of course, the
Federalists ... compacted themselves on the other
side."<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p>Of all within the Hall of Delegates, and, indeed,
among the thousands then in Richmond, only two
persons appeared to be perfectly at ease. One of
them was John Marshall, the other was Aaron Burr.
Winfield Scott tells us of the manner of the imperiled
man as he appeared in court on that sultry midday
of May: "There he stood, in the hands of power,
on the brink of danger, as composed, as immovable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
as one of Canova's living marbles." But, says Scott,
"Marshall was the master spirit of the scene."<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<p>Gathered about Burr were four of his counsel, the
fifth and most powerful of his defenders, Luther
Martin, not yet having arrived. The now elderly
Edmund Randolph, bearing himself with "overawing
dignity"; John Wickham, whose commanding
presence corresponded well with his distinguished
talents and extensive learning; Benjamin Botts, a
very young lawyer, but of conceded ability and
noted for a courage, physical and moral, that nothing
could shake; and another young attorney, John
Baker, a cripple, as well known for his wit as Botts
for his fearlessness&mdash;this was the group of men that
appeared for the defense.</p>

<p>For the prosecution came Jefferson's United States
District Attorney, George Hay&mdash;eager, nervous,
and not supremely equipped either in mind or
attainments; William Wirt&mdash;as handsome and attractive
as he was eloquent and accomplished, his
extreme dissipation<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> now abandoned, and who, by
his brilliant gifts of intellect and character, was beginning
to lay the solid foundations of his notable
career; and Alexander MacRae, then Lieutenant-Governor
of Virginia&mdash;a sour-tempered, aggressive,
well-informed, and alert old Scotchman, pitiless in
his use of sarcasm, caring not the least whom he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
offended if he thought that his affronts might help
the cause for which he fought. David Robertson,
the stenographer who reported the trial, was a
scholar speaking five or six languages.<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a></p>

<p>With all these men Marshall was intimately acquainted,
and he was well assured that, in making
up his mind in any question which arose, he would
have that assistance upon which he so much relied&mdash;exhaustive
argument and complete exposition of
all the learning on the subject to be decided.</p>

<p>Marshall was liked and admired by the lawyers
on both sides, except George Hay, who took Jefferson's
view of the Chief Justice. Indeed, the ardent
young Republican District Attorney passionately
espoused any opinion the President expressed. The
whole bar understood the strength and limitations
of the Chief Justice, the power of his intellect no
less than his unfamiliarity with precedents and the
learning of the law. From these circumstances, and
from Marshall's political wisdom in giving the lawyers
a free hand, resulted a series of forensic encounters
seldom witnessed or even tolerated in a
court of justice.</p>

<p>The first step in the proceedings was the examination
by the grand jury of the Government's witnesses,
and its return, or refusal to return, bills of
indictment against Burr. When the clerk had called
the names of those summoned on the grand jury,
Burr arose and addressed the court. Clad in black
silk, hair powdered and queue tied in perfect fashion,
the extreme pallor of his face in striking contrast to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
his large black eyes, he made a rare picture of elegance
and distinction in the uncouth surroundings
of that democratic assemblage.</p>

<p>The accused man spoke with a quiet dignity and
an "impressive distinctness" which, throughout the
trial, so wrought upon the minds of the auditors that,
fifty years afterward, some of those who heard him
could repeat sentences spoken by him.<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> Burr now
objected to the panel of the grand jury. The law,
he said, required the marshal to summon twenty-four
freeholders; if any of these had been struck off
and others summoned, the act was illegal, and he
demanded to know whether this had been done.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p>For an hour or more the opposing counsel wrangled
over this point. Randolph hints at the strategy
of the defense: "There never was such a torrent of
prejudice excited against any man, before a court
of justice, as against colonel Burr, and by means
which we shall presently unfold." Marshall sustained
Burr's exception: undoubtedly the marshal
had acted "with the most scrupulous regard to
what he believed to be the law," but, if he had
changed the original panel, he had transcended his
authority.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> It was then developed that the panel
had been changed, and the persons thus illegally
placed on the grand jury were dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<p>"With regret," Burr demanded the right to challenge
the remainder of the grand jury "for favour."<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a>
Hay conceded the point, and Burr challenged Sena<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>tor
William Branch Giles. Merely upon the documents
in Jefferson's Special Message to Congress,
Giles had advocated that the writ of habeas corpus
be suspended, and this, argued Burr, he could have
done only if he supposed "that there was a rebellion
or insurrection, and a public danger, of no common
kind." This action of Giles was a matter of record;
moreover, he had publicly made statements to the
same effect.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>Senator Giles admitted that he had acted and
spoken as Burr charged; and while denying that
he held any "personal resentments against the accused,"
and asserting that he could act fairly as
a grand juror, he graciously offered to withdraw.
Marshall mildly observed that "if any gentleman
has made up and declared his mind, it would be best
for him to withdraw." With superb courtesy, Burr
disavowed any reflection on Giles; it was merely
above "human nature" that he should not be prejudiced.
"So far from having any animosity against
him, he would have been one of those whom I should
have ranked among my personal friends."</p>

<p>Burr then challenged Colonel Wilson Cary Nicholas,<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a>
who spiritedly demanded the objections to him.
Nicholas "entertained a bitterly personal animosity"
against him, replied Burr. He would not, however,
insist upon "further inquiry" if Nicholas would
withdraw as Giles had done. Nicholas then addressed
the court. He had been a member of the
National House, he said, "when the attempt was
made to elect colonel Burr president," and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>body
knew how he felt about that incident. He had
been in the Senate for three years "while colonel
Burr was president of that body," and had done all
he could to nominate Clinton in Burr's stead.</p>

<p>His suspicions had been "very much excited"
when Burr made his Western journey, and he had
openly stated his "uncommon anxiety" concerning
"not only the prosperity, but the union of the
states." Therefore, he had not desired to serve on
the grand jury and had asked the marshal to excuse
him. He had finally consented solely from his delicate
sense of public duty. Also, said Nicholas, he
had been threatened with the publication of one of
the "most severe pieces" against him if he served
on the grand jury; and this inclined him to "defy
[his] enemies [rather] than to ask their mercy or
forbearance."</p>

<p>His friends had advised him not to make mention
of this incident in court; but, although he was "not
scrupulous of acquiring, in this way, a reputation of
scrupulous delicacy," and had determined to heed
the counsel of his friends, still, he now found himself
so confused that he did not know just what he ought
to do. On the whole, however, he thought he would
follow the example of Senator Giles and withdraw.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p>At that very moment, Nicholas was a Republican
candidate for Congress and, next to Giles, Jefferson's
principal political agent in Virginia. Four days after
Burr had been brought to Richmond, Jefferson had
written Nicholas a letter of fulsome flattery "beseeching"
him to return to the National House in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
the place of the President's son-in-law, Thomas
Mann Randolph, who had determined to retire, and
assuring him of the Republican leadership if he
would do so.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>

<p>Thus, for a moment, was revealed a thread of
that web of intrigue and indirect influence which,
throughout the trial, was woven to enmesh judge,
jury, and public. Burr was instantly upon his feet
denouncing in his quiet but authoritative manner
the "attempt to intimidate" Nicholas as "a contrivance
of some of [his] enemies for the purpose of
irritating" the hot-blooded Republican politician
"and increasing the public prejudice against [Burr];
since it was calculated to throw suspicion on [his]
cause." Neither he nor his friends had ever "sanctioned"
such an act; they were wholly ignorant of
it, and viewed it "with indignation."<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Eggleston, another of the grand jurors,
now asked to be excused because he had declared his
belief of Burr's guilt; but he admitted, in answer to
Marshall's questions, that he could act justly in the
impending investigation. Burr said that he would
not object to Eggleston: "the industry which has
been used through this country [Virginia] to prejudice
my cause, leaves me very little chance, indeed, of
an impartial jury." Eggleston's "candour ... in
excepting to himself" caused Burr to hope that he
would "endeavour to be impartial." But let Marshall
decide&mdash;Burr would be "perfectly passive."<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
The scrupulous grand juror was retained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>John Randolph and Dr. William Foushee were
then added to the grand jury panel and Marshall
appointed Randolph foreman.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> He promptly asked
to be excused because of his "strong prepossession."
"Really," observed Burr, "I am afraid we shall not
be able to find any man without this prepossession."
Marshall again stated "that a man must not only
have formed but declared an opinion in order to
excuse him from serving on the jury." So Randolph
was sworn as foreman, the oath administered to all,
and at last the grand jury was formed.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<p>Marshall then instructed the jury, the substance of
his charge being to the same effect as his opinion in
the case of Bollmann and Swartwout. Burr asked
the Chief Justice also to advise the men who were to
decide the question of his indictment "as to the admissability
of certain evidence" which he supposed
Hay would lay before them. The District Attorney
objected to any favor being shown Burr, "who," he
declared, "stood on the same footing with every
other man charged with crime."</p>

<p>For once Burr unleashed his deep but sternly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
repressed feeling: "Would to God," he cried, his
voice vibrant with emotion, "that I did stand on
the same ground with every other man. This is the
first time [since the military seizure] that I have been
permitted to enjoy the rights of a citizen. How have
I been brought hither?" Marshall checked this passionate
outburst: it was not proper, he admonished
both Hay and Burr, to "go into these digressions."</p>

<p>His composure restored, Burr insisted that he
should be accorded "the same privileges and rights
which belonged to every other citizen." He would
not now urge his objections to Marshall's opinion
in the Bollmann-Swartwout case;<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> but he pointed
out "the best informed juryman might be ignorant
of many points ... relating to testimony, ... for instance,
as to the article of papers," and he wished
Marshall to inform the jury on these matters of law.</p>

<p>A brief, sharp debate sprang up, during which
Burr's counsel spoke of the "host of prejudices
raised against [their] client," taunted Hay with his
admission "that there was no man who had not
formed an opinion," and denounced "the activity of
the Government."<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Upon Hay's pledging himself
that he would submit no testimony to the grand
jury "without notice being first given to Colonel
Burr and his counsel," Marshall adjourned the
court that the attorneys might prepare for "further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
discussion." The Government was not ready to
present any testimony on either the following day
or on Monday because its principal witness, General
Wilkinson, had not arrived.</p>

<p>Hay now sent Jefferson his first report of the
progress of the case. Burr had steadily been making
friends, and this irritated the District Attorney
more than the legal difficulties before him. "I am
surprised, and afflicted, when I see how much, and
by how many, this man has been patronised and
supported." Hay assured Jefferson, however, that
he would "this day move to commit him for treason."<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>
Accordingly, he announced in the presence
of the grand jury that he would again ask the court
to imprison Burr on that accusation. In order, he
said, that the impropriety of mentioning the subject
in their presence might be made plain, Burr moved
that the grand jury be withdrawn. Marshall sustained
the motion; and after the grand jury had
retired, Hay formally moved the court to order
Burr's incarceration upon the charge of treason.<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a></p>

<p>Burr's counsel, surprised and angered, loudly
complained that no notice had been given them.
With a great show of generosity, Hay offered to delay
his motion until the next day. "Not a moment's
postponement," shouted Botts, his fighting nature
thoroughly aroused. Hay's "extraordinary application,"
he said, was to place upon the court the functions
of the grand jury. Burr wanted no delay. His
dearest wish was to "satisfy his country ... and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
his prosecutors, that he is innocent." Was ever a
man so pursued? He had been made the victim of
unparalleled military despotism; his legal rights
had been ignored; his person and papers unlawfully
seized. The public had been excited to anger.
Through newspaper threats and "popular clamor"
attempts had been made to intimidate every officer
of the court. Consider "the multitude around us"&mdash;they
must not be further infected "with the
poison already too plentifully infused."</p>

<p>Did Hay mean to "open the case more fully?"
inquired Marshall. No, answered Hay; but Wilkinson's
arrival in Virginia might be announced before
he reached Richmond. Who could tell the effect
on Burr of such dread tidings? The culprit might
escape; he must be safely held.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> "The bets were
against Burr that he would abscond, should W. come
to Richmond."<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a></p>

<p>If Wilkinson is so important a witness, "why is
he not here?" demanded Wickham. Everybody
knew that "a set of busy people ... are laboring to
ruin" Burr. "The press, from one end of the continent
to the other, has been enlisted ... to excite
prejudices" against him. Let the case be decided
upon "the evidence of sworn witnesses" instead of
"the floating rumours of the day."</p>

<p>Did the Government's counsel wish that "the
multitude around us should be prejudiced by garbled
evidences?" Wickham avowed that he could not
understand Hay's motives, but of this he was sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>&mdash;that
if, thereafter, the Government wished to oppress
any citizen, drag him by military force over the
country, prejudice the people against him, it would
"pursue the very same course which has now been
taken against colonel Burr." The prosecution admitted
that it had not enough evidence to lay before
the grand jury, yet they asked to parade what they
had before the court. Why?&mdash;"to nourish and keep
alive" the old prejudices now growing stale.<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<p>Wirt answered at great length. He understood
Wickham's purpose, he said. It was to "divert the
public attention from Aaron Burr," and "shift the
popular displeasure ... to another quarter." Wickham's
speech was not meant for the court, exclaimed
Wirt, but for "the people who surround us," and
so, of course, Marshall would not heed it. Burr's
counsel "would convert this judicial inquiry into a
political question ... between Thomas Jefferson and
Aaron Burr."</p>

<p>Not to be outdone by his gifted associate, Hay
poured forth a stream of words: "Why does he
[Burr] turn from defending himself to attack the
administration?" he asked. He did not answer his
own question, but Edmund Randolph did: "An order
has been given to treat colonel Burr as an outlaw,
and to burn and destroy him and his property."
Jefferson, when requested, had furnished the House
information;&mdash;"would to God he had stopped here,
as an executive officer ought to have done!" But
instead he had also pronounced Burr guilty&mdash;an
opinion calculated to affect courts, juries, the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
Wickham detailed the treatment of Burr, "the only
man in the nation whose rights are not secure from
violation."<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

<p>Burr himself closed this unexpected debate, so
suddenly thrust upon his counsel and himself. His
speech is a model of that simple, perspicuous, and
condensed statement of which he was so perfectly
the master. He presented the law, and then, turning
to Hay, said that two months previous the District
Attorney had declared that he had enough evidence
to justify the commitment, and surely he must have
it now. Nearly half a year had elapsed since Jefferson
had "declared that there was a crime," and yet,
even now, the Government was not ready. Nevertheless,
the court was again asked to imprison
him for an alleged offense for which the prosecution
admitted it had not so much as the slight
evidence required to secure his indictment by the
grand jury.</p>

<p>Were the Government and he "on equal terms?"
Far from it. "The United States [could] have compulsory
process" to obtain affidavits against him
but he had "no such advantage." So the prosecution
demanded his imprisonment on <i>ex parte</i> evidence
which would be contradicted by his own
evidence if he could adduce it. Worse still! The
Government affidavits against him "are put into
the newspapers, and they fall into the hands of the
grand jury." Meanwhile, he was helpless. And now
the opinion of the court was also to be added to the
forces working to undo him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p>Wirt and Hay had charged his counsel "with
declamation against the government." Certainly
nobody could attribute "declamation" to him; but,
said Burr, his restrained voice tense with suppressed
emotion, "no government is so high as to be beyond
the reach of criticism"&mdash;that was a fundamental
principle of liberty. This was especially true when
the Government prosecuted a citizen, because of
"the vast disproportion of means which exists between
it and the accused." And "if ever there was a
case which justified this vigilance, it is certainly the
present one"; let Marshall consider the "uncommon
activity" of the Administration.</p>

<p>Burr would, he said, "merely state a few" of
the instances of "harrassing, ... contrary to law" to
which he had been subjected. His "friends had been
every where seized by the military authority,"
dragged before "particular tribunals," and forced
to give testimony; his papers taken; orders to kill
him issued; post-offices broken open and robbed&mdash;"nothing
seemed too extravagant to be forgiven by
the amiable morality of this government." Yet it
was for milder conduct that Americans rightly condemned
"European despotisms."</p>

<p>The President was a great lawyer; surely "he ought
to know what constitutes war. Six months ago he
proclaimed that there was a civil war. And yet, for
six months they have been hunting for it and cannot
find one spot where it existed. There was, to be sure,
a most terrible war in the newspapers; but no where
else." He had been haled before the court in
Kentucky&mdash;and no proof; in Mississippi&mdash;and no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
proof. The Spaniards actually invaded American
territory&mdash;even then there was no war.</p>

<p>Thus early the record itself discloses the dramatic,
and, for Marshall, perilous, conditions under which
this peculiar trial was to be conducted. The record
makes clear, also, the plan of defense which Burr
and his counsel were forced to adopt. They must
dull the edge of public opinion sharpened to a biting
keenness by Jefferson. They must appeal to the
people's hatred of oppression, fear of military rule,
love of justice. To do this they must attack, attack,
always attack.</p>

<p>They must also utilize every technical weapon of
the law. At another time and place they could have
waived, to Burr's advantage, all legal rights, insisted
upon his indictment, and gone to trial, relying only
upon the evidence. But not in the Virginia of 1807,
with the mob spirit striving to overawe jury and
court, and ready to break out in violent action&mdash;not
at the moment when the reign of Thomas Jefferson
had reached the highest degree of popular
idolatry.</p>

<p>Just as Hay, Wirt, and MacRae generally spoke
to the spectators far more than to the Bench, so did
Wickham, Randolph, Botts, and Martin.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> Both sides
so addressed the audience that their hearers were
able to repeat to the thousands who could not get
into the hall what had been said by the advocates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
From the very first the celebrated trial of Aaron
Burr was a contest for the momentary favor of public
opinion; and, in addition, on the part of Burr, an
invoking of the law to shield him from that popular
wrath which the best efforts of his defenders
could not wholly appease.</p>

<p>Marshall faced a problem of uncommon difficulty.
It was no small matter to come between the populace
and its prey&mdash;no light adventure to brave the
vengeance of Thomas Jefferson. Not only his public
repute<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>&mdash;perhaps even his personal safety<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> and
his official life<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a>&mdash;but also the now increasing influence
and prestige of the National Judiciary were
in peril. However, he must do justice no matter
what befell&mdash;he must, at all hazards, pronounce
the law truly and enforce it bravely, but with elastic
method. He must be not only a just, but also
an understanding, judge.</p>

<p>When court opened next morning, Marshall was
ready with a written opinion. Concisely he stated
the questions to be decided: Had the court the power
to commit Burr, and, if so, ought the circumstances
to restrain the exercise of it? Neither side had made
the first point, and Marshall mentioned it only
"to show that it [had] been considered." Briefly he
demonstrated that the court was clothed with authority
to grant Hay's motion. Should that power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
then, be exerted? Marshall thought that it should.
The Government had the right to ask Burr's incarceration
at any time, and it was the duty of the
court to hear such a motion.</p>

<p>Thus far spoke Marshall the judge. In the closing
sentences the voice of the politician was heard: "The
court perceives and regrets that the result of this
motion may be publications unfavourable to the
justice, and to the right decision of the case"; but
this must be remedied "by other means than by refusing
to hear the motion." Every honest and intelligent
man extremely deplored "any attempt ...
to prejudice the public judgment, and to try any
person," not by the law and the evidence, but "by
public feelings which may be and often are artificially
excited against the innocent, as well as the
guilty, ... a practice not less dangerous than it is
criminal." Nevertheless he could not "suppress
motions, which either party may have a legal right
to make." So, if Hay persisted, he might "open his
testimony."<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a></p>

<p>While Marshall, in Richmond, was reading this
opinion, Jefferson, in Washington, was writing
directions to Hay. He was furious at "the criminal
and voluntary retirement" of Giles and Nicholas
from the grand jury "with the permission of the
court." The opening of the prosecution had certainly
begun "under very inauspicious circumstances."
One thing was clear: "It becomes our
duty to provide that full testimony shall be laid before
the Legislature, and through them the public."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>If the grand jury should indict Burr, then Hay
must furnish Jefferson with all the evidence, "taken
as verbatim as possible." Should Burr not be indicted,
and no trial held and no witnesses questioned
in court, then Hay must "have every man
privately examined by way of affidavit," and send
Jefferson "the whole testimony" in that form.
"This should be done before they receive their
compensation, that they may not evade examination.
Go into any expense necessary for this purpose,<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a>
&amp; meet it from the funds provided to the
Attorney general for the other expenses."<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's decision perplexed Hay. It interfered
with his campaign of publicity. If only Marshall had
denied his motion, how effectively could that incident
have been used on public sentiment! But now
the Republican press could not exclaim against
Marshall's "leniency" to "traitors" as it had done.
The people were deprived of fresh fuel for their patriotic
indignation. Jefferson would be at a loss for a
new pretext to arouse them against the encroachments
of the courts upon their "liberties."</p>

<p>Hay strove to retrieve the Government from this
disheartening situation. He was "struck," he said,
with Marshall's reference to "publications." To
avoid such newspaper notoriety, he would try to
arrange with Burr's counsel for the prisoner's appearance
under additional bail, thus avoiding insistence
upon the Government's request for the imprisonment
of the accused. Would Marshall adjourn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
court that this amicable arrangement might be
brought about? Marshall would and did.</p>

<p>But next day found Hay unrelieved; Burr's counsel
had refused, in writing, to furnish a single dollar of
additional bail. To his intense regret, Hay lamented
that he was thus forced to examine his witnesses.
Driven to this unpleasant duty, he would follow the
"chronological order&mdash;first the depositions of the
witnesses who were absent, and afterwards those
who were present."<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a></p>

<p>The alert Wickham demanded "strict legal order."
The Government must establish two points: the perpetration
of an overt act, and "that colonel Burr
was concerned in it."<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> Hay floundered&mdash;there was
one great plot, he said, the two parts of it "intimately
blended"; the projected attack on Spain and
the plot to divide the Union were inseparable&mdash;he
must have a free hand if he were to prove this
wedded iniquity. Was Burr afraid to trust the
court?</p>

<p>Far from it, cried Wickham, "but we do fear to
prejudicate the mind of the grand jury.... All propriety
and decorum have been set at naught; every
idle tale which is set afloat has been eagerly caught
at. The people here are interested by them; and they
circulate all over the country."<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> Marshall interrupted:
"No evidence certainly has any bearing ...
unless the overt act be proved." Hay might, however,
"pursue his own course."</p>

<p>A long altercation followed. Botts made an extended
speech, in the course of which he discredited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
the Government's witnesses before they were introduced.
They were from all over the country, he
said, their "names, faces and characters, are alike
unknown to colonel Burr." To what were they to
testify? Burr did not know&mdash;could not possibly
ascertain. "His character has long been upon public
torture; and wherever that happens ... the impulses
to false testimony are numerous. Sometimes
men emerge from the sinks of vice and obscurity
into patronage and distinction by circulating interesting
tales, as all those of the marvelous kind are.
Others, from expectation of office and reward, volunteer;
while timidity, in a third class, seeks to
guard against the apprehended danger, by magnifying
trifling stories of alarm.... When they are afterwards
called to give testimony, perjury will not appal
them, if it be necessary to save their reputations."
Therefore, reasoned Botts&mdash;and most justly&mdash;strict
rules of evidence were necessary.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a></p>

<p>Hay insisted that Wilkinson's affidavit demonstrated
Burr's intentions. That "goes for nothing,"
said Marshall, "if there was no other evidence to
prove the overt act." Therefore, "no part of it [was]
admissible at this time."<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> Thrice Marshall patiently
reminded Government counsel that they
charged an overt act of treason and must prove it.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p>Hay called Peter Taylor, Blennerhassett's former
gardener, and Jacob Allbright, once a laborer on
the eccentric Irishman's now famous island. Both
were illiterate and in utter terror of the Government.
Allbright was a Dutchman who spoke Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>lish
poorly; Taylor was an Englishman; and they
told stories equally fantastic. Taylor related that
Mrs. Blennerhassett had sent him to Kentucky
with a letter to Burr warning him not to return to
the island; that Burr was surprised at the people's
hostility; that Blennerhassett, who was also in Kentucky,
confided they were going to take Mexico and
make Burr king, and Theodosia queen when her
father died; also that Burr, Blennerhassett, and their
friends had bought "eight hundred thousand acres
of land" and "wanted young men to settle it," and
that any of these who should prove refractory, he
[Blennerhassett] said, "by God, ... I will stab";
that Blennerhassett had also said it would be a fine
thing to divide the Union, but Burr and himself
could not do it alone.</p>

<p>Taylor further testified that Blennerhassett once
sent him with a letter to a Dr. Bennett, who lived in
Ohio, proposing to buy arms in his charge belonging
to the United States&mdash;if Bennett could not sell, he
was to tell where they were, and Blennerhassett
"would steal them away in the night"; that his
employer charged him "to get [the letter] back
and burn it, for it contained high treason"; and
that the faithful Taylor had done this in Bennett's
presence.</p>

<p>Taylor narrated the scene on the island when
Blennerhassett and thirty men in four boats fled in
the night: some of the men had guns and there was
some powder and lead.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>Jacob Allbright told a tale still more marvelous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Soon after his employment, Mrs. Blennerhassett had
come to this dull and ignorant laborer, while he was
working on a kiln for drying corn, and confided to
him that Burr and her husband "were going to lay
in provisions for an army for a year"; that Blennerhassett
himself had asked Allbright to join the
expedition which was going "to settle a new country."
Two men whom the Dutch laborer met in the
woods hunting had revealed to him that they were
"Burr's men," and had disclosed that "they were
going to take a silver mine from the Spanish"; that
when the party was ready to leave the island, General
Tupper of Ohio had "laid his hands upon Blennerhassett
and said, 'your body is in my hands
in the name of the commonwealth,'" whereupon
"seven or eight muskets [were] levelled" at the
General; that Tupper then observed he hoped they
would not shoot, and one of the desperadoes replied,
"I'd as lieve as not"; and that Tupper then
"changed his speech," wished them "to escape
safe," and bade them Godspeed.</p>

<p>Allbright and Taylor were two of the hundreds to
whom the Government's printed questions had been
previously put by agents of the Administration. In
his answers to these, Allbright had said that the
muskets were pointed at Tupper as a joke.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> Both
Taylor and he swore that Burr was not on the
island when Blennerhassett's men assembled there
and stealthily departed in hasty flight.</p>

<p>To the reading of the deposition of Jacob Dunbaugh,
Burr's counsel strenuously objected. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
not shown that Dunbaugh himself could not be produced;
the certification of the justice of the peace,
before whom the deposition was taken, was defective.
For the remainder of the day the opposing lawyers
wrangled over these points. Marshall adjourned
court and "took time to consider the subject till the
next day"; when, in a long and painfully technical
opinion, he ruled that Dunbaugh's affidavit could
not be admitted because it was not properly authenticated.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

<span class="caption">LUTHER MARTIN</span>
</div>

<p>May 28, when the court again convened, was
made notable by an event other than the reading of
the unnecessarily long opinion which Marshall had
written during the night: the crimson-faced, bellicose
superman of the law, Luther Martin, appeared
as one of Burr's counsel.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> The great lawyer had
formed an ardent admiration and warm friendship
for Burr during the trial of the Chase impeachment,<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
and this had been intensified when he met
Theodosia, with whom he became infatuated.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> He
had voluntarily come to his friend's assistance, and
soon threw himself into the defense of Burr with all
the passion of his tempestuous nature and all the
power and learning of his phenomenal intellect.</p>

<p>After vexatious contendings by counsel as to
whether Burr should give additional bail,<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> Marshall
declared that "as very improper effects on the public
mind [might] be produced," he wished that no opinion
would be required of him previous to the action of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
the grand jury; and that the "appearance of colonel
Burr could be secured without ... proceeding in this
inquiry." Burr denied the right of the court to hold
him on bail, but said that if Marshall was "embarrassed,"
he voluntarily would furnish additional bail,
"provided it should be understood that no opinion
on the question even of probable cause was pronounced
by the court."<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> Marshall agreed; and Burr
with four sureties, among whom was Luther Martin,
gave bond for ten thousand dollars more.<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<p>Day after day, court, grand jury, counsel, and
spectators awaited the coming of Wilkinson. The
Government refused to present any testimony to
the grand jury until he arrived, although scores of
witnesses were present. Andrew Jackson was very
much in town, as we have seen. So was Commodore
Truxtun. And "General" William Eaton was also
on hand, spending his time, when court was not in
session, in the bar-rooms of Richmond.</p>

<p>Wearing a "tremendous hat," clad in gay colored
coat and trousers, with a flaming Turkish belt
around his waist, Eaton was already beginning to
weaken the local hatred of Burr by his loud blustering
against the quiet, courteous, dignified prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>
Also, at gambling-tables, and by bets that Burr
would be convicted, the African hero was making
free with the ten thousand dollars paid him by the
Government soon after he made the bloodcurdling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
affidavit<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> with which Jefferson had so startled Congress
and the country.</p>

<p>While proceedings lagged, Marshall enjoyed the
dinners and parties that, more than ever, were given
by Richmond society. On one of these occasions
that eminent and ardent Republican jurist, St.
George Tucker, was present, and between him and
Marshall an animated discussion grew out of the
charge that Burr had plotted to cause the secession
of the Western States; it was a forecast of the
tremendous debate that was to end only at Appomattox.
"Judge Tucker, though a violent Democrat,"
records Blennerhassett, "seriously contended
... with Judge Marshall ... that any State in the Union
is at any time competent to recede from the same,
though Marshall strongly opposed this doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>Hay wrote Jefferson of the slow progress of the
case, and the President "hastened" to instruct his
district attorney: If the grand jury should refuse to
indict Burr, Hay must not deliver the pardon to
Bollmann; otherwise, "his evidence is deemed entirely
essential, &amp; ... his pardon is to be produced
before he goes to the book." Jefferson had become
more severe as he thought of Bollmann, and now
actually directed Hay to show, in open court, to
this new object of Presidential displeasure, the
"sacredly confidential" statement given Jefferson
under pledge of the latter's "word of honor" that it
should never leave his hand. Hay was directed to ask
Bollmann whether "it was not his handwriting."<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>With the same ink on his pen the President wrote
his son-in-law that he had heard only of the first day
of the trial, but was convinced that Marshall meant
to do all he could for Burr. Marshall's partiality
showed, insisted Jefferson, "the original error of
establishing a judiciary independent of the nation,
and which, from the citadel of the law can turn it's
guns on those they were meant to defend, &amp; controul
&amp; fashion their proceedings to it's own will."<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>Hay quickly answered Jefferson: The trial had
"indeed commenced under inauspicious circumstances,"
and doubtless these would continue to be
unfavorable. Nobody could predict the outcome.
Hay was so exhausted and in such a state of mind
that he could not describe "the very extraordinary
occurrences in this very extraordinary examination."
Burr's "partizans" were gloating over the failure of
Wilkinson to arrive. Bollmann would neither accept
nor reject the pardon; he was "as unprincipled as his
leader." Marshall's refusal to admit Dunbaugh's
affidavit was plainly illegal&mdash;"his eyes [were] almost
closed" to justice.<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson now showered Hay with orders. The
reference in argument to Marshall's opinion in Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison greatly angered him: "Stop ... citing
that case as authority, and have it denied to be
law," he directed Hay, and gave him the arguments
to be used against it. An entire letter is devoted to
this one subject: "I have long wished for a proper
occasion to have the gratuitous opinion in Marbury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
v. Madison brought before the public, &amp; denounced
as not law; &amp; I think the present a fortunate one,
because it occupies such a place in the public
attention."</p>

<p>Hay was openly to declare that the President
rejected Marshall's opinion in that case as having
been "given extra-judicially &amp; against law," and
that the reverse of it would be Jefferson's "rule of
action." If necessary, Hay might state that the
President himself had said this.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>Back and forth went letters from Hay to Jefferson
and from Jefferson to Hay,<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> the one asking for instructions
and the other eagerly supplying them.
To others, however, the President explained that he
could take no part in any judicial proceeding, since
to do so would subject him to "just censure."<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the abundance of Government witnesses
available, the prosecution refused to go on
until the redoubtable savior of his country had arrived
from New Orleans. Twice the grand jury had
to be dismissed for several days, in order, merrily
wrote Washington Irving, "that they might go
home, see their wives, get their clothes washed, and
flog their negroes."<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> A crowd of men ready to testify
was held. The swarms of spectators waited with
angry impatience. "If the great hero of the South
does not arrive, it is a chance if we have any trial
this term,"<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> commented Irving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>During this period of inaction and suspense, suddenly
arose one of the most important and exciting
questions of the entire trial. On June 9, while counsel
and court were aimlessly discussing Wilkinson's
journey to Richmond, Burr arose and said that he
had a "proposition to submit" to the court. The
President in his Message to Congress had made
mention of the letter and other papers dated October
21, which he had received from Wilkinson. It
had now become material that this letter should be
produced in court.</p>

<p>Moreover, since the Government had "attempted
to infer certain intentions on [his] part, from certain
transactions," such as his flight from Mississippi,
it had become necessary to prove the conditions
that forced him to attempt that escape. Vital
among these were orders of the Government to the
army and navy "to destroy" Burr's "person and
property." He had seen these orders in print,<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> and
an officer had assured him that such instructions had
actually been issued. It was indispensable that this
be established. The Secretary of the Navy had refused
to allow him or his counsel to inspect these
orders. "Hence," maintained Burr, "I feel it necessary
... to call upon [the court] to issue a subp&#339;na
to the President of the United States, with a clause,
requiring him to produce certain papers; or in
other words, to issue the subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i>." If
Hay would agree to produce these documents, the
motion would not be made.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>Hay was sadly confused. He would try to get all
the papers wanted if Marshall would say that they
were material. How, asked Marshall, could the
court decide that question without inspecting the papers?
"Why ... issue a subp&#339;na to the President?"
inquired Hay. Because, responded Marshall, "in
case of a refusal to send the papers, the officer himself
may be present to show cause. This subp&#339;na is
issued only where fears of this sort are entertained."</p>

<p>Counsel on both sides became angry. Hay denied
the authority of the court to issue such a writ.
Marshall called for argument, because, he said, "I
am not prepared to give an opinion on this point."<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a>
Thus arose the bitter forensic struggle that preceded
Marshall's historic order to Jefferson to come into
court with the papers demanded, or to show cause
why he should not do so.</p>

<p>Hay instantly dispatched the news to Jefferson;
he hoped the papers would be "forwarded without
delay," because "detention of them will afford [Burr]
pretext for clamor." Besides, "L. Martin has been
here a long time, perfectly inactive"; he was yearning
to attack Jefferson and this would "furnish a
topic."<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>The President responded with dignified caution:
"Reserving the necessary right of the President of
the U S to decide, independently of all other authority,
what papers, coming to him as President, the
public interests permit to be communicated, &amp; to
whom, I assure you of my readiness under that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
restriction, voluntarily to furnish on all occasions,
whatever the purposes of justice may require." He
had given the Wilkinson letter, he said, to the
Attorney-General, together with all other documents
relating to Burr, and had directed the Secretary of
War to search the files so that he (Jefferson) could
"judge what can &amp; ought to be done" about sending
any order of the Department to Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p>

<p>When Marshall opened court on June 10, Burr
made affidavit that the letters and orders might be
material to his defense. Hay announced that he had
written Jefferson to send the desired papers and
expected to receive them within five days. They
could not, however, be material, and he did not
wish to discuss them. Martin insisted that the papers
be produced. Wickham asked what Hay was
trying to do&mdash;probably trying to gain time to send
to Washington for instructions as to how the prosecution
should now act.</p>

<p>Was not "an accused man ... to obtain witnesses
in his behalf?" Never had the denial of such a right
been heard of "since the declaration of American
Independence." The despotic treatment of Burr
called aloud not only for the court's protection of
the persecuted man, but "to the protection of every
citizen in the country as well."<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> So it seemed to
that discerning fledgling author, Washington Irving.
"I am very much mistaken," he wrote, "if the most
underhand ... measures have not been observed
toward him. He, however, retains his serenity."<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>Luther Martin now took the lead: Was Jefferson
"a kind of sovereign?" No! "He is no more than
a servant of the people." Yet who could tell what
he would do? In this case his Cabinet members,
"under presidential influence," had refused copies
of official orders. In another case "the officers of the
government screened themselves ... under the sanction
of the president's name."<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> The same might be
done again; for this reason Burr applied "directly
to the president." The choleric legal giant from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Maryland could no longer restrain his wrath: "This
is a peculiar case," he shouted. "The president
has undertaken to prejudice my client by declaring,
that 'of his guilt there can be no doubt.' He
has assumed to himself the knowledge of the Supreme
Being himself, and pretended to search the
heart of my highly respected friend. He has proclaimed
him a traitor in the face of that country,
which has rewarded him. He has let slip the dogs
of war, the hell-hounds of persecution, to hunt down
my friend."</p>

<p>"And would this president of the United States,
who has raised all this absurd clamor, pretend to
keep back the papers which are wanted for this trial,
where life itself is at stake?" That was a denial of
"a sacred principle. Whoever withholds, wilfully,
information that would save the life of a person,
charged with a capital offence, is substantially a
murderer, and so recorded in the register of heaven."
Did Jefferson want Burr convicted? Impossible
thought! "Would the president of the United States
give his enemies ... the proud opportunity of saying
that colonel Burr is the victim of anger, jealousy
and hatred?" Interspersed with these outbursts of
vitriolic eloquence, Martin cited legal authorities.
Never, since the days of Patrick Henry, had Richmond
heard such a defiance of power.<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>Alexander MacRae did his best to break the force
of Martin's impetuous attack. The present question
was "whether this court has the right to issue a
subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i>, addressed to the president of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
the United States." MacRae admitted that "a
subp&#339;na may issue against him as well as against
any other man." Still, the President was not bound
to disclose "confidential communications." Had not
Marshall himself so ruled on that point in the matter
of Attorney-General Lincoln at the hearing in Marbury
<i>vs.</i> Madison?<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p>Botts came into the fray with his keen-edged sarcasm.
Hay and Wirt and MacRae had "reprobated"
the action of Chase when, in the trial of Cooper, that
judge had refused to issue the writ now asked for;
yet now they relied on that very precedent. "I congratulate
them upon their dereliction of the old
democratic opinions."<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p>Wirt argued long and brilliantly. What were the
"orders," military and naval, which had been described
so thrillingly? Merely to "apprehend Aaron
Burr, and <i>if ... necessary ... to destroy his boats</i>." Even
the "sanguinary and despotic" orders depicted
by Burr and his counsel would have been a "great
and glorious virtue" if Burr "was aiming a blow at
the vitals of our government and liberty." Martin's
"fervid language" had not been inspired merely by
devotion to "his honourable friend," said Wirt. It
was the continued pursuit of a "policy settled ... before
Mr. Martin came to Richmond." Burr's counsel,
on the slightest pretext, "flew off at a tangent ...
to launch into declamations against the government,
exhibiting the prisoner continually as a persecuted
patriot: a Russell or a Sidney, bleeding under the
scourge of a despot, and dying for virtue's sake!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>He wished to know "what gentlemen can intend,
expect, or hope, from these perpetual philippics
against the government? Do they flatter themselves
that this court feel political prejudices which will
supply the place of argument and of innocence on the
part of the prisoner? Their conduct amounts to an
insinuation of the sort." What would a foreigner
"infer from hearing ... the judiciary told that the
administration are 'blood hounds,' hunting this man
with a keen and savage thirst for blood," and witnessing
the court receive this language "with all
complacency?" Surely no conclusion could be made
very "honourable to the court. It would only be
inferred, while they are thus suffered to roll and luxuriate
in these gross invectives against the administration,
that they are furnishing the joys of a Mahomitan
paradise to the court as well as to their
client."<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a></p>

<p>Here was as bold a challenge to Marshall as ever
Erskine flung in the face of judicial arrogance; and
it had effect. Before adjourning court, Marshall
addressed counsel and auditors: he had not interfered
with assertions of counsel, made "in the heat
of debate," although he had not approved of them.
But now that Wirt had made "a pointed appeal" to
the court, and the Judges "had been called upon to
support their own dignity, by preventing the government
from being abused," he would express his opinion.
"Gentlemen on both sides had acted improperly
in the style and spirit of their remarks; they had
been to blame in endeavoring to excite the prejudices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
of the people; and had repeatedly accused each other
of doing what they forget they have done themselves."
Marshall therefore "expressed a wish that
counsel ... would confine themselves on every occasion
to the point really before the court; that their
own good sense and regard for their characters required
them to follow such a course." He "hoped
that they would not hereafter deviate from it."<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a></p>

<p>His gentle admonition was scarcely heeded by the
enraged lawyers. Wickham's very "tone of voice,"
exclaimed Hay, was "calculated to excite irritation,
and intended for the multitude." Of course, Jefferson
<i>could</i> be subp&#339;naed as a witness; that was in the
discretion of the court. But Marshall ought not to
grant the writ unless justice required it. The letter
might be "of a private nature"; if so, it ought not
to be produced. Martin's statement that Burr had a
right to resist was a "monstrous ... doctrine which
would have been abhorred even in the most turbulent
period of the French revolution, by the jacobins
of 1794!"</p>

<p>Suppose, said Hay, that Jefferson had been "misled,"
and that "Burr was peaceably engaged in the
project of settling his Washita lands!" Did that
give him "a right to resist the president's orders to
stop him?" Never! "This would be treason." The
assertion of the right to disobey the President was
the offspring of "a new-born zeal of some of the
gentlemen, in defence of the rights of man."<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p>Why await the arrival of Wilkinson? asked Edmund
Randolph. What was expected of "that great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
accomplisher of all things?" Apparently this: "He
is to support ... the <i>sing-song</i> and the ballads of
treason and conspiracy, which we have heard delivered
from one extremity of the continent to the
other. The funeral pile of the prosecution is already
prepared by the hands of the public attorney, and
nothing is wanting to kindle the fatal blaze but the
torch of James Wilkinson," who "is to officiate as
the high priest of this human sacrifice.... Wilkinson
will do many things rather than disappoint the
wonder-seizing appetite of America, which for
months together he has been gratifying by the most
miraculous actions." If Burr were found guilty,
Wilkinson would stand acquitted; if not, then "the
character, the reputation, every thing ... will be
gone for ever from general Wilkinson."</p>

<p>Randolph's speech was a masterpiece of invective.
"The President testifies, that Wilkinson has testified
to him fully against Burr; then let that letter be
produced. The President's declaration of Burr's
guilt is unconstitutional." It was not the business
of the President "to give opinions concerning the
guilt or innocence of any person." Directly addressing
Marshall, Randolph continued: "With respect
to your exhortation," that Burr's appeal was to the
court alone, "we demand justice only, and if you
cannot exorcise the demon of prejudice, you can
chain him down to law and reason, and then we shall
have nothing to fear."<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a></p>

<p>The audacious Martin respected Marshall's appeal
to counsel even less than Hay and Randolph had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
done. The prosecution had objected to the production
of Wilkinson's mysterious letter to Jefferson
because it might contain confidential statements.
"What, sir," he shouted, "shall the cabinet of the
United States be converted into a lion's mouth of
Venice, or into a <i>repertorium</i> of the inquisition?
Shall envy, hatred, and all the malignant passions
pour their poison into that cabinet against the character
and life of a fellow citizen, and yet that cabinet
not be examined in vindication of that character and
to protect that life?"</p>

<p>Genuine fury shook Martin. "Is the life of a man,
lately in high public esteem ... to be endangered for
the sake of punctilio to the president?" Obey illegal
orders! "If every order, however arbitrary and
unjust, is to be obeyed, we are slaves as much as
the inhabitants of Turkey. If the presidential edicts
are to be the supreme law, and the officers of the
government have but to register them, as formerly
in France, ... we are as subject to despotism, as ...
the subjects of the former '<i>Grands Monarques</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<p>Now occurred as strange a mingling of acrimony
and learning as ever enlightened and enlivened a
court. Burr's counsel demanded that Marshall deliver
a supplementary charge to the grand jury.
Marshall was magnificently cautious. He would, he
said, instruct the jury as confused questions arose.
On further reflection and argument&mdash;Marshall's
dearly beloved argument&mdash;he wrote additional instructions,<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
but would not at present announce them.
There must be an actual "levying of war"; the overt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
act must be established; no matter what suspicions
were entertained, what plans had been formed, what
enterprises had been projected, there could be "no
treason without an overt act."<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a></p>

<p>In such would-and-would-not fashion Marshall
contrived to waive this issue for the time being.
Then he delivered that opinion which proved his
courage, divided Republicans, stirred all America,
and furnished a theme of disputation that remains
fresh to the present day. He decided to grant Burr's
demand that Jefferson be called into court with the
papers asked for.</p>

<p>The purpose of the motion was, said Marshall, to
produce copies of the army and navy orders for the
seizure of Burr, the original of Wilkinson's letter to
Jefferson, and the President's answer. To accomplish
this object legally, Burr had applied for the
well-known subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i> directed to the
President of the United States.</p>

<p>The objection that until the grand jury had indicted
Burr, no process could issue to aid him to
obtain testimony, was, Marshall would not say new
elsewhere, but certainly it had never before been
heard of in Virginia. "So far back as any knowledge
of our jurisprudence is possessed, the uniform practice
of this country [Virginia] has been, to permit any
individual ... charged with any crime, to prepare for
his defence and to obtain the process of the court, for
the purpose of enabling him so to do." An accused
person must expect indictment, and has a right to
compel the attendance of witnesses to meet it. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
was perhaps his duty to exercise that right: "The
genius and character of our laws and usages are
friendly, not to condemnation at all events, but to a
fair and impartial trial."</p>

<p>In all criminal prosecutions the Constitution,
Marshall pointed out, guarantees to the prisoner "a
speedy and public trial, and to compulsory process
for obtaining witnesses in his favour." The courts
must hold this "sacred," must construe it "to be
something more than a dead letter." Moreover, the
act of Congress undoubtedly contemplated "that,
in all capital cases, the accused shall be entitled to
process before indictment found." Thus "immemorial
usage," the language of the Constitution, the
National statute, all combined to give "any person,
charged with a crime in the courts of the United
States, ... a right, before, as well as after indictment,
to the process of the court to compel the attendance
of his witnesses."</p>

<p>But could "a subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i> be directed to the
president of the United States?" If it could, ought
it to be "in this case"? Neither in the Constitution
nor in an act of Congress is there any exception
whatever to the right given all persons charged with
crime to compel the attendance of witnesses. "No
person could claim an exemption." True, in Great
Britain it was considered "to be incompatible with
his dignity" for the King "to appear under the process
of the court." But did this apply to the President
of the United States? Marshall stated the many
differences between the status of the British King
and that of the American President.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>The only possible ground for exempting the President
"from the general provisions of the constitution"
would be, of course, that "his duties ... demand
his whole time for national objects. But," continued
Marshall, "it is apparent, that this demand is
not unremitting"&mdash;a statement at which Jefferson
took particular offense.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> Should the President be so
occupied when his presence in court is required, "it
would be sworn on the return of the subp&#339;na, and
would rather constitute a reason for not obeying the
process of the court, than a reason against its being
issued."</p>

<p>To be sure, any court would "much more cheerfully"
dispense with the duty of issuing a subp&#339;na
to the President than to perform that duty; "but,
if it be a duty, the court can have no choice" but to
perform it.</p>

<p>If, "as is admitted by counsel for the United
States," the President may be "summoned to give
his personal attendance to testify," was that power
nullified because "his testimony depends on a paper
in his possession, not on facts which have come to
his knowledge otherwise than by writing?" Such a
distinction is "too much attenuated to be countenanced
in the tribunals of a just and humane nation."<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a>
The character of the paper desired as evidence,
and not "the character of the person who
holds it," determines "the propriety of introducing
any paper ... as testimony."</p>

<p>It followed, then, that "a subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i> may
issue to any person to whom an ordinary subp&#339;na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
may issue." The only difference between the two
writs is that one requires only the attendance of the
witness, while the other directs also "bringing with
him a paper in his custody."</p>

<p>In many States the process of subp&#339;na <i>duces
tecum</i> issues of course, and without any action of the
judge. In Virginia, however, leave of the court is
required; but "no case exists ... in which the motion
... has been denied or in which it has been
opposed," when "founded on an affidavit."</p>

<p>The Chief Justice declared that he would not issue
the writ if it were apparent that the object of the
accused in applying for it was "not really in his own
defence, but for purposes which the court ought to
discountenance. The court would not lend its aid to
motions obviously designed to manifest disrespect to
the government; but the court has no right to refuse
its aid to motions for papers to which the accused
may be entitled, and which may be material in his
defence." If this was true in the matter of Burr's
application, "would it not be a blot in the page,
which records the judicial proceedings of this country,
if, in a case of such serious import as this, the
accused should be denied the use" of papers on
which his life might depend?</p>

<p>Marshall carefully examined a case cited by the
Government<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> in which Justice Paterson had presided,
at the same time paying to the memory of
the deceased jurist a tribute of esteem and affection.
He answered with tedious particularity the objections
to the production of Wilkinson's letter to Jeffer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>son,
and then referred to the "disrespect" which the
Government counsel had asserted would be shown
to the President if Marshall should order him to
appear in court with the letters and orders.</p>

<p>"This court feels many, perhaps peculiar motives,
for manifesting as guarded respect for the chief
magistrate of the Union as is compatible with its
official duties." But, declared Marshall, "to go
beyond these ... would deserve some other appellation
than the term respect."</p>

<p>If the prosecution should end, "<i>as is expected</i>" by
the Government, those who withheld from Burr any
paper necessary to his defense would, of course, bitterly
regret their conduct. "I will not say, that this
circumstance would ... tarnish the reputation of the
Government; but I will say, that it would justly
tarnish the reputation of the court, which had given
its sanction to its being withheld."</p>

<p>With all that impressiveness of voice and manner
which, on occasion, so transformed Marshall, he
exclaimed: "Might I be permitted to utter one sentiment,
with respect to myself, it would be to deplore,
most earnestly, the occasion which should compel
me to look back on any part of my official conduct
with so much self-reproach as I should feel, could I
declare, on the information now possessed, that the
accused is not entitled to the letter in question, if
it should be really important to him."</p>

<p>Let a subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i>, therefore ruled the
Chief Justice, be issued, directed to Thomas Jefferson,
President of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing that Marshall had before said or done so
highly excited counsel for the prosecution as his
assertion that they "expected" Burr's conviction.
The auditors were almost as deeply stirred. Considering
the peculiarly mild nature of the man and
his habitual self-restraint, Marshall's language was
a pointed rebuke, not only to the Government's
attorneys, but to the Administration itself. Even
Marshall's friends thought that he had gone too far.</p>

<p>Instantly MacRae was on his feet. He resented
Marshall's phrase, and denied that the Government
or its counsel "wished" the conviction of Burr&mdash;such
a desire was "completely abhorrent to [their]
feelings." MacRae hoped that Marshall did not
express such an opinion deliberately, but that it had
"accidentally fallen from the pen of [his] honor."</p>

<p>Marshall answered that he did not intend to
charge the Administration or its attorneys with a
desire to convict Burr "whether he was guilty or
innocent"; but, he added dryly, "gentlemen had so
often, and so uniformly asserted, that colonel Burr
was guilty, and they had so often repeated it before
the testimony was perceived, on which that guilt
could alone be substantiated, that it appeared to
him probable, that they were not indifferent on the
subject."<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a></p>

<p>Hay, in his report to Jefferson, gave more space
to this incident than he did to all other features of
the case. He told the President that Marshall had
issued the dreaded process and then quoted the
offensive sentence. "This expression," he relates,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
"produced a very strong &amp; very general sensation.
The friends of the Judge, both personal &amp; political,
Condemned it. Alex<sup>r&#803;</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Rae rose as soon as he had
finished, and in terms mild yet determined, demanded
an explanation of it. The Judge actually
blushed." And, triumphantly continues the District
Attorney, "he did attempt an explanation.... I observed,
with an indifference which was not assumed,
that I had endeavored to do my duty, according to
my own judgment and feelings, that I regretted
nothing that I had said or done, that I should pursue
the same Course throughout, and that it was a
truth, that I cared not what <i>any man</i> said or thought
about it."</p>

<p>Marshall himself was perturbed. "About three
hours afterwards," Hay tells Jefferson, "when the
Crowd was thinned, the Judge acknowledged the
impropriety of the expression objected to, &amp; informed
us from the Bench that he had erased it."
The Chief Justice even apologized to the wrathful
Hay: "After he had adjourned the Court, he descended
from the Bench, and told me that he regretted
the remark, and then by way of apology
said, that he had been so pressed for time, that he
had never read the opinion, after he had written it."
Hay loftily adds: "An observation from me that I
did not perceive any connection between my declarations
&amp; his remark, or how the former could regularly
be the Cause of the latter, closed the Conversation."<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p>Hay despondently goes on to say that "there
never was such a trial from the beginning of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
world to this day." And what should he do about
Bollmann? That wretch "resolutely refuses his
pardon &amp; is determined not to utter a word, if he can
avoid it. The pardon lies on the clerks table. The
Court are to decide whether he is really pardoned or
not. Martin says he is not pardoned. Such are the
questions, with which we are worried. If the Judge
says that he is not pardoned, I will take the pardon
back. What shall I then do with him?"</p>

<p>The immediate effect of Marshall's ruling was the
one Jefferson most dreaded. For the first time, most
Republicans approved of the opinion of John Marshall.
In the fanatical politics of the time there was
enough of honest adherence to the American ideal,
that all men are equal in the eyes of the law, to justify
the calling of a President, even Thomas Jefferson,
before a court of justice.</p>

<p>Such a militant Republican and devotee of Jefferson
as Thomas Ritchie, editor of the Richmond
<i>Enquirer</i>, the party organ in Virginia, did not criticize
Marshall, nor did a single adverse comment on
Marshall appear in that paper during the remainder
of the trial. Not till the final verdict was rendered
did Ritchie condemn him.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>Before he learned of Marshall's ruling, Jefferson
had once more written the District Attorney giving
him well-stated arguments against the issuance of
the dreaded subp&#339;na.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> When he did receive the
doleful tidings, Jefferson's anger blazed&mdash;but this
time chiefly at Luther Martin, who was, he wrote,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
an "unprincipled &amp; impudent federal bull-dog."
But there was a way open to dispose of him: Martin
had known all about Burr's criminal enterprise.
Jefferson had received a letter from Baltimore stating
that this had been believed generally in that city
"for more than a twelve-month." Let Hay subp&#339;na
as a witness the writer of this letter&mdash;one
Greybell.</p>

<p>Something must be done to "put down" the
troublesome "bull-dog": "Shall L M be summoned
as a witness against Burr?" Or "shall we move to
commit L M as <i>particeps criminis</i> with Burr? Greybell
will fix upon him misprision of treason at least
... and add another proof that the most clamorous
defenders of Burr are all his accomplices."</p>

<p>As for Bollmann! "If [he] finally rejects his pardon,
&amp; the Judge decides it to have no effect ...
move to commit him immediately for treason or
misdemeanor."<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> But Bollmann, in open court, had
refused Jefferson's pardon six days before the President's
vindictively emotional letter was written.</p>

<p>After Marshall delivered his opinion on the question
of the subp&#339;na to Jefferson, Burr insisted, in
an argument as convincing as it was brief, that the
Chief Justice should now deliver the supplementary
charge to the grand jury as to what evidence it could
legally consider. Marshall announced that he would
do so on the following Monday.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

<p>Several witnesses for the Government were sworn,
among them Commodore Thomas Truxtun, Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>modore
Stephen Decatur, and "General" William
Eaton. When Dr. Erich Bollmann was called to the
book, Hay stopped the administration of the oath.
Bollmann had told the Government all about Burr's
"plans, designs and views," said the District Attorney;
"as these communications might criminate
doctor Bollman before the grand jury, the president
has communicated to me this pardon"&mdash;and
Hay held out the shameful document. He had already
offered it to Bollmann, he informed Marshall,
but that incomprehensible person would neither
accept nor reject it. His evidence was "extremely
material"; the pardon would "completely exonerate
him from all the penalties of the law." And so, exclaimed
Hay, "in the presence of this court, I offer
this pardon to him, and if he refuses, I shall deposit
it with the clerk for his use." Then turning to Bollmann,
Hay dramatically asked:</p>

<p>"Will you accept this pardon?"</p>

<p>"No, I will not, sir," firmly answered Bollmann.</p>

<p>Then, said Hay, the witness must be sent to the
grand jury "with an intimation, that he has been
pardoned."</p>

<p>"It has always been doctor Bollman's intention
to refuse this pardon," broke in Luther Martin.
He had not done so before only "because he wished
to have this opportunity of publicly rejecting it."</p>

<p>Witness after witness was sworn and sent to the
grand jury, Hay and Martin quarreling over the
effect of Jefferson's pardon of Bollmann. Marshall
said that it would be better "to settle ... the validity
of the pardon before he was sent to the grand jury."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Again Hay offered Bollmann the offensive guarantee
of immunity; again it was refused; again Martin
protested.</p>

<p>"Are you then willing to hear doctor Bollman
indicted?" asked Hay, white with anger. "Take
care," he theatrically cried to Martin, "in what an
awful condition you are placing this gentleman."</p>

<p>Bollmann could not be frightened, retorted Martin:
"He is a man of too much honour to trust his
reputation to the course which you prescribe for
him."</p>

<p>Marshall "would perceive," volunteered the nonplussed
and exasperated Hay, "that doctor Bollman
now possessed so much zeal, as even to encounter
the risk of an indictment for treason."</p>

<p>The Chief Justice announced that he could not,
"at present, declare, whether he be really pardoned
or not." He must, he said, "take time to deliberate."</p>

<p>Hay persisted: "Categorically then I ask you, Mr.
Bollman, do you accept your pardon?"</p>

<p>"I have already answered that question several
times. I say no," responded Bollmann. "I repeat,
that I would have refused it before, but that I
wished this opportunity of publicly declaring it."<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>Bollmann was represented by an attorney of his
own, a Mr. Williams, who now cited an immense
array of authorities on the various questions involved.
Counsel on both sides entered into the discussion.
One "reason why doctor Bollman has refused
this pardon" was, said Martin, "that it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
be considered as an admission of guilt." But
"doctor Bollman does not admit that he has been
guilty. He does not consider a pardon as necessary
for an innocent man. Doctor Bollman, sir, knows
what he has to fear from the persecution of an angry
government; but he will brave it all."</p>

<p>Yes! cried Martin, with immense effect on the excited
spectators, "the man, who did so much to rescue
the marquis la Fayette from his imprisonment,
and who has been known at so many courts, bears
too great a regard for his reputation, to wish to have
it sounded throughout Europe, that he was compelled
to abandon his honour through a fear of unjust
persecution." Finally the true-hearted and defiant
Bollmann was sent to the grand jury without
having accepted the pardon, and without the legal
effect of its offer having been decided.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

<p>When the Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>, containing Marshall's
opinion on the issuance of the subp&#339;na <i>duces
tecum</i>, reached Washington, the President wrote to
Hay an answer of great ability, in which Jefferson
the lawyer shines brilliantly forth: "As is usual
where an opinion is to be supported, right or wrong,
he [Marshall] dwells much on smaller objections,
and passes over those which are solid.... He admits
no exception" to the rule "that all persons owe
obedience to subp&#339;nas ... unless it can be produced
in his law books."</p>

<p>"But," argues Jefferson, "if the Constitution enjoins
on a particular officer to be always engaged in
a particular set of duties imposed on him, does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
this supersede the general law, subjecting him to
minor duties inconsistent with these? The Constitution
enjoins his [the President's] constant agency
in the concerns of 6. millions of people. Is the law
paramount to this, which calls on him on behalf of
a single one?"</p>

<p>Let Marshall smoke his own tobacco: suppose the
Sheriff of Henrico County should summon the Chief
Justice to help "quell a riot"? Under the "general
law" he is "a part of the <i>posse</i> of the State
sheriff"; yet, "would the Judge abandon major
duties to perform lesser ones?" Or, imagine that a
court in the most distant territory of the United
States "commands, by subp&#339;nas, the attendance of
all the judges of the Supreme Court. Would they
abandon their posts as judges, and the interests of
millions committed to them, to serve the purposes
of a single individual?"</p>

<p>The Judiciary was incessantly proclaiming its
"independence," and asserting that "the leading
principle of our Constitution is the independence
of the Legislature, executive and judiciary of each
other." But where would be such independence, if
the President "were subject to the <i>commands</i> of the
latter, &amp; to imprisonment for disobedience; if the
several courts could bandy him from pillar to post,
keep him constantly trudging from north to south
&amp; east to west, and withdraw him entirely from his
constitutional duties?"</p>

<p>Jefferson vigorously resented Marshall's personal
reference to him. "If he alludes to our annual retirement
from the seat of government, during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
sickly season," Hay ought to tell Marshall that
Jefferson carried on his Executive duties at Monticello.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a></p>

<p>Crowded with sensations as the proceedings had
been from the first, they now reached a stage of thrilling
movement and high color. The long-awaited and
much-discussed Wilkinson had at last arrived "with
ten witnesses, eight of them Burr's select men," as
Hay gleefully reported to Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> Fully attired
in the showy uniform of the period, to the last item
of martial decoration, the fat, pompous Commanding
General of the American armies strode through
the crowded streets of Richmond and made his way
among the awed and gaping throng to his seat by
the side of the Government's attorneys.</p>

<p>Washington Irving reports that "Wilkinson strutted
into the Court, and ... stood for a moment
swelling like a turkey cock." Burr ignored him
until Marshall "directed the clerk to swear General
Wilkinson; at the mention of the name Burr turned
his head, looked him full in the face with one of his
piercing regards, swept his eye over his whole person
from head to foot, as if to scan its dimensions, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
then coolly ... went on conversing with his counsel
as tranquilly as ever."<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson delighted Jefferson with a different description:
"I saluted the Bench &amp; in spite of myself
my Eyes darted a flash of indignation at the little
Traitor, on whom they continued fixed until I
was called to the Book&mdash;here Sir I found my expectations
verified&mdash;This Lyon hearted Eagle Eyed
Hero, sinking under the weight of conscious guilt,
with haggard Eye, made an Effort to meet the indignant
salutation of outraged Honor, but it was in vain,
his audacity failed Him, He averted his face, grew
pale &amp; affected passion to conceal his perturbation."<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p>But the countenance of a thin, long-faced, roughly
garbed man sitting among the waiting witnesses was
not composed when Wilkinson appeared. For three
weeks Andrew Jackson to all whom he met had been
expressing his opinion of Wilkinson in the unrestrained
language of the fighting frontiersman;<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> and
he now fiercely gazed upon the creature whom he
regarded as a triple traitor, his own face furious with
scorn and loathing.</p>

<p>Within the bar also sat that brave and noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
man whose career of unbroken victories had made
the most brilliant and honorable page thus far in
the record of the American Navy&mdash;Commodore
Thomas Truxtun. He was dressed in civilian attire.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>
By his side, clad as a man of business, sat a brother
naval hero of the old days, Commodore Stephen Decatur.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>
A third of the group was Benjamin Stoddert,
the Secretary of the Navy under President Adams.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>In striking contrast with the dignified appearance
and modest deportment of these gray-haired friends
was the gaudily appareled, aggressive mannered
Eaton, his restlessness and his complexion advertising
those excesses which were already disgusting
even the hard-drinking men then gathered in Richmond.
Dozens of inconspicuous witnesses found
humbler places in the audience, among them Sergeant
Jacob Dunbaugh, bearing himself with mingled
bravado, insolence, and humility, the stripes on the
sleeve of his uniform designating the position to which
Wilkinson had restored him.</p>

<p>Dunbaugh had gone before the grand jury on
Saturday, as had Bollmann; and now, one by one,
Truxtun, Decatur, Eaton, and others were sent to
testify before that body.</p>

<p>Eaton told the grand jury the same tale related in
his now famous affidavit.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a></p>

<p>Commodore Truxtun testified to facts as different
from the statements made by "the hero of Derne"<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>
as though Burr had been two utterly contrasted persons.
During the same period that Burr had seen
Eaton, he had also conversed with him, said Truxtun.
Burr mentioned a great Western land speculation,
the digging of a canal, and the building of a bridge.
Later on Burr had told him that "in the event of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
war with Spain, which he thought inevitable, ... he
contemplated an expedition to Mexico," and had
asked Truxtun "if the Havanna could be easily
taken ... and what would be the best mode of attacking
Carthagena and La Vera Cruz by land and
sea." The Commodore had given Burr his opinion
"very freely," part of it being that "it would require
a naval force." Burr had answered that "<i>that</i>
might be obtained," and had frankly asked Truxtun
if he "would take the command of a naval expedition."</p>

<p>"I asked him," testified Truxtun, "if the executive
of the United States were privy to, or concerned
in the project? He answered <i>emphatically</i> that he
was not: ... I told Mr. Burr that I would have nothing
to do with it.... He observed to me, that in the
event of a war [with Spain], he intended to establish
an independent government in Mexico; that Wilkinson,
the army, and many officers of the navy
would join.... Wilkinson had projected the expedition,
and he had matured it; that many greater
men than Wilkinson would join, and that thousands
to the westward would join."</p>

<p>In some of the conversations "Burr mentioned to
me that the government was weak," testified Truxtun,
"and he wished me to get the navy of the United
States out of my head;<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> ... and not to think more of
those men at Washington; that he wished to <i>see</i> or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
<i>make</i> me, (I do not recollect which of those two
terms he used) an Admiral."</p>

<p>Burr wished Truxtun to write to Wilkinson, to
whom he was about to dispatch couriers, but Truxtun
declined, as he "had no subject to write about."
Again Burr urged Truxtun to join the enterprise&mdash;"several
officers would be pleased at being put under
my command.... The expedition could not fail&mdash;the
Mexicans were ripe for revolt." Burr "was
sanguine there would be war," but "if he was disappointed
as to the event of war, he was about to
complete a contract for a large quantity of land on
the Washita; that he intended to invite his friends
to settle it; that in one year he would have a thousand
families of respectable and fashionable people, and
some of them of considerable property; that it was
a fine country, and that they would have a charming
society, and in two years he would have doubled the
number of settlers; and being on the frontier, he
would be ready to move whenever a war took
place....</p>

<p>"All his conversations respecting military and
naval subjects, and the Mexican expedition, were
in the event of a war with Spain." Truxtun testified
that he and Burr were "very intimate"; that Burr
talked to him with "no reserve"; and that he "never
heard [Burr] speak of a division of the union."</p>

<p>Burr had shown Truxtun the plan of a "kind of
boat that plies between Paulus-Hook and New-York,"
and had asked whether such craft would
do for the Mississippi River and its tributaries, especially
on voyages upstream. Truxtun had said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
they would. Burr had asked him to give the plans
to "a naval constructor to make several copies," and
Truxtun had done so. Burr explained that "he intended
those boats for the conveyance of agricultural
products to market at New-Orleans, and in the
event of war [with Spain], for transports."</p>

<p>The Commodore testified that Burr made no
proposition to invade Mexico "whether there was
war [with Spain] or not." He was so sure that Burr
meant to settle the Washita lands that he was
"astonished" at the newspaper accounts of Burr's
treasonable designs after he had gone to the Western
country for the second time.</p>

<p>Truxtun had freely complained of what amounted
to his discharge from the Navy, being "pretty full"
himself of "resentment against the Government,"
and Burr "joined [him] in opinion" on the Administration.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a></p>

<p>Jacob Dunbaugh told a weird tale. At Fort
Massac he had been under Captain Bissel and in
touch with Burr. His superior officer had granted
him a furlough to accompany Burr for twenty days.
Before leaving, Captain Bissel had "sent for [Dunbaugh]
to his quarters," told him to keep "any secrets"
Burr had confided to him, and "advised" him
"never to forsake Col. Burr"; and "at the same
time he made [Dunbaugh] a present of a silver breast
plate."</p>

<p>After Dunbaugh had joined the expedition, Burr
had tried to persuade him to get "ten or twelve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
of the best men" among his nineteen fellow soldiers
then at Chickasaw Bluffs to desert and join
the expedition; but the virtuous sergeant had refused.
Then Burr had asked him to "steal from the
garrison arms such as muskets, fusees and rifles,"
but Dunbaugh had also declined this reasonable
request. As soon as Burr learned of Wilkinson's
action, he told Dunbaugh to come ashore with him
armed "with a rifle," and to "conceal a bayonet under
[his] clothes.... He told me he was going to tell me
something I must never relate again, ... that General
Wilkinson had betrayed him ... that he had
played the devil with him, and had proved the
greatest traitor on the earth."</p>

<p>Just before the militia broke up the expedition,
Burr and Wylie, his secretary, got "an axe, auger
and saw," and "went into Colonel Burr's private
room and began to chop," Burr first having "ordered
no person to go out." Dunbaugh did go out,
however, and "got on the top of the boat." When
the chopping ceased, he saw that "a Mr. Pryor and
a Mr. Tooly got out of the window," and "saw two
bundles of arms tied up with cords, and sunk by
cords going through the holes at the gunwales of
Colonel Burr's boat." The vigilant Dunbaugh also
saw "about forty or forty-three stands [of arms],
besides pistols, swords, blunderbusses, fusees, and
tomahawks"; and there were bayonets too.<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a></p>

<p>Next Wilkinson detailed to the grand jury the
revelations he had made to Jefferson. He produced
Burr's cipher letter to him, and was forced to admit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
that he had left out the opening sentence of it&mdash;"Yours,
postmarked 13th of May, is received"&mdash;and
that he had erased some words of it and substituted
others. He recounted the alarming disclosures
he had so cunningly extracted from Burr's messenger,
and enlarged upon the heroic measures he had
taken to crush treason and capture traitors. For
four days<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> Wilkinson held forth, and himself escaped
indictment by the narrow margin of 7 to 9 of
the sixteen grand jurymen. All the jurymen, however,
appear to have believed him to be a scoundrel.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>"The mammoth of iniquity escaped," wrote John
Randolph in acrid disgust, "not that any man pretended
to think him innocent, but upon certain wire-drawn
distinctions that I will not pester you with.
Wilkinson is the only man I ever saw who was from
the bark to the very core a villain.... Perhaps you
never saw human nature in so degraded a situation
as in the person of Wilkinson before the grand jury,
and yet this man stands on the very summit and
pinnacle of executive favor."<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p>Samuel Swartwout, the courier who had delivered
Burr's ill-fated letter, "most positively denied" that
he had made the revelations which Wilkinson
claimed to have drawn from him.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> The youthful
Swartwout as deeply impressed the grand jury with
his honesty and truthfulness as Wilkinson impressed
that body with his untrustworthiness and duplicity.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a></p>

<p>Peter Taylor and Jacob Allbright then recounted
their experiences.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> And the Morgans told of Burr's
visit and of their inferences from his mysterious tones
of voice, glances of eye, and cryptic expressions. So
it was, that in spite of overwhelming testimony of
other witnesses,<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> who swore that Burr's purposes
were to settle the Washita lands and in the event of
war with Spain, and only in that event, to invade
Mexico, with never an intimation of any project
hostile to the United States&mdash;so it was that bills of
indictment for treason and for misdemeanor were,
on June 24, found against Aaron Burr of New York
and Harman Blennerhassett of Virginia. The indictment
for treason charged that on December 13,
1806, at Blennerhassett's island in Virginia, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
had levied war on the United States; and the one for
misdemeanor alleged that, at the same time and
place, they had set on foot an armed expedition
against territory belonging to His Catholic Majesty,
Charles IV of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a></p>

<p>This result of the grand jury's investigations was
reached because of that body's misunderstanding of
Marshall's charge and of his opinion in the Bollmann
and Swartwout case.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p>John Randolph, as foreman of the grand jury, his
nose close to the ground on the scent of the principal
culprit, came into court the day after the indictment
of Burr and Blennerhassett and asked for the letter
from Wilkinson to Burr, referred to in Burr's cipher
dispatch to Wilkinson, and now in the possession of
the accused. Randolph said that, of course, the
grand jury could not ask Burr to appear before
them as a witness, but that they did want the letter.</p>

<p>Marshall declared "that the grand jury were
perfectly right in the opinion." Burr said that he
could not reveal a confidential communication, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>less
"the extremity of circumstances might impel
him to such a conduct." He could not, for the moment,
decide; but that "unless it were extorted from
him by law" he could not even "deliberate on the
proposition to deliver up any thing which had been
confided to his honour."</p>

<p>Marshall announced that there was no "objection
to the grand jury calling before them and examining
any man ... who laid under an indictment." Martin
agreed "there could be no objection."</p>

<p>The grand jury did not want Burr as a witness,
said John Randolph. They asked only for the letter.
If they should wish Burr's presence at all, it would
be only for the purpose of identifying it. So the
grand jury withdrew.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a></p>

<p>Hay was swift to tell his superior all about it,
although he trembled between gratification and
alarm. "If every trial were to be like that, I am
doubtful whether my patience will sustain me while
I am wading thro' this abyss of human depravity."</p>

<p>Dutifully he informed the President that he feared
that "the Gr: Jury had not dismissed all their
suspicions of Wilkinson," for John Randolph had
asked for his cipher letter to Burr. Then he described
to Jefferson the intolerable prisoner's conduct:
"Burr rose immediately, &amp; declared that no
consideration, no calamity, no desperation, should
induce <i>him</i> to betray a letter confidentially written.
He could not even allow himself to deliberate on
a point, where his conduct was prescribed by the
clearest principles of honor &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>Hay then related what Marshall and John Randolph
had said, underscoring the statement that
"the Gr: Jury <i>did not want A. B. as a witness</i>." Hay
did full credit, however, to Burr's appearance of
candor: "The attitude &amp; tone assumed by Burr
struck everybody. There was an appearance of

<p>Day after day was consumed in argument on
points of evidence, while the grand jury were examining
witnesses. Marshall delivered a long written
opinion upon the question as to whether a witness
could be forced to give testimony which he
believed might criminate himself. The District
Attorney read Jefferson's two letters upon the subject
of the subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i>. No pretext was
too fragile to be seized by one side or the other, as
the occasion for argument upon it demanded&mdash;for
instance, whether or not the District Attorney
might send interrogatories to the grand jury. Always
the lawyers spoke to the crowd as well as to
the court, and their passages at arms became ever
sharper.<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson is "an honest man and a patriot"&mdash;no!
he is a liar and a thief; Louisiana is a "poor,
unfortunate, enslaved country"; letters had been
seized by "foulness and violence"; the arguments
of Burr's attorneys are "mere declamations"; the
Government's agents are striving to prevent Burr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
from having "a fair trial ... the newspapers and
party writers are employed to <i>cry</i> and <i>write</i> him
down; his counsel are denounced for daring to defend
him; the passions of the grand jury are endeavored

Hay's mind is "harder than Ajax's seven fold shield
of bull's hide"; Edmund Randolph came into court
"with mysterious looks of awe and terror ... as if he
had something to communicate which was too horrible
to be told"; Hay is always "on his heroics";
he "hopped up like a parched pea"; the object of
Burr's counsel is "to prejudice the surrounding
multitude against General Wilkinson"; one newspaper
tale is "as impudent a falsehood as ever malignity
had uttered"&mdash;such was the language with
which the arguments were adorned. They were,
however, well sprinkled with citations of authority.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

was that the culprit should be drawn prostrate at the tails of

intestines ripped out and burned "before the eyes" of the victim;
and finally the head cut off. Details still more shocking were frequently
added. See sentences upon William, Lord Russell, July 14,

Ogden and Smith." In June and July, 1806, William S. Smith and
Samuel G. Ogden of New York were tried in the United States Court
for that district upon indictments charging them with having aided
Miranda in his attack on Caracas, Venezuela. They made affidavit
that the testimony of James Madison, Secretary of State, Henry
Dearborn, Secretary of War, Robert Smith, Secretary of the Navy,
and three clerks of the State Department, was necessary to their
defense. Accordingly these officials were summoned to appear in
court. They refused, but on July 8, 1806, wrote to the Judges&mdash;William
Paterson of the Supreme Court and Matthias B. Talmadge,
District Judge&mdash;that the President "has specially signified to us that
our official duties cannot ... be at this juncture dispensed with."
(<i>Trials of Smith and Ogden</i>: Lloyd, stenographer, 6-7.)
</p><p>
The motion for an attachment to bring the secretaries and their
clerks into court was argued for three days. The court disagreed, and
no action therefore was taken. (<i>Ib.</i> 7-90.) One judge (undoubtedly
Paterson) was "of opinion, that the absent witnesses should be laid
under a rule to show cause, why an attachment should not be issued
against them"; the other (Talmadge) held "that neither an attachment
in the first instance, nor a rule to show cause ought to be
granted." (<i>Ib.</i> 89.)
</p><p>
Talmadge was a Republican, appointed by Jefferson, and charged
heavily against the defendants (<i>ib.</i> 236-42, 287); but they were
acquitted.
</p><p>
The case was regarded as a political prosecution, and the refusal of
Cabinet officers and department clerks to obey the summons of the
court, together with Judge Talmadge's disagreement with Justice
Paterson&mdash;who in disgust immediately left the bench under plea of
ill-health (<i>ib.</i> 90)&mdash;and the subsequent conduct of the trial judge, were
commented upon unfavorably. These facts led to Martin's reference
during the Burr trial.</p></div>

Wilkinson reached Richmond by stage on Saturday, June 13. He
was accompanied by John Graham and Captain Gaines, the ordinary
witnesses having been sent ahead on a pilot boat. (Graham to Madison,
May 11, 1807, "Letters in Relation," MSS. Lib. Cong.) Graham
incorrectly dated his letter May 11 instead of June 11. He had left
New Orleans in May, and in the excitement of landing had evidently
forgotten that a new month had come.

was living on a farm in New Jersey. No officer in any navy ever made
a better record for gallantry, seamanship, and whole-hearted devotion
to his country. The list of his successful engagements is amazing. He
was as high-spirited as he was fearless and honorable.
</p><p>
In 1802, when in command of the squadron that was being equipped
for our war with Tripoli, Truxtun most properly asked that a captain
be appointed to command the flagship. The Navy was in great disfavor
with Jefferson and the whole Republican Party, and naval affairs
were sadly mismanaged or neglected. Truxtun's reasonable request
was refused by the Administration, and he wrote a letter of indignant
protest to the Secretary of the Navy. To the surprise and dismay of
the experienced and competent officer, Jefferson and his Cabinet construed
his spirited letter as a resignation from the service, and, against
Truxtun's wishes, accepted it as such. Thus the American Navy
lost one of its ablest officers at the very height of his powers. Truxtun
at the time was fifty-two years old. No single act of Jefferson's
Administration is more discreditable than this untimely ending of a
great career.</p></div>

of the same name. He had had a career in the American Navy as
honorable but not so distinguished as that of Truxtun; and his service
had been ended by an unhappy circumstance, but one less humiliating
than that which severed Truxtun's connection with the Navy.
</p><p>
The unworthiest act of the expiring Federalist Congress of 1801,
and one which all Republicans eagerly supported, was that authorizing
most of the ships of the Navy to be sold or laid up and most of the
naval officers discharged. (Act of March 3, 1801, <i>Annals</i>, 6th Cong.
1st and 2d Sess. 1557-59.) Among the men whose life profession was
thus cut off, and whose notable services to their country were thus
rewarded, was Commodore Stephen Decatur, who thereafter engaged
in business in Philadelphia.</p></div>

that the American Navy was really created. Both Truxtun and
Decatur won their greatest sea battles in our naval war with France,
while Stoddert was Secretary. The three men were close friends and
all of them warmly resented the demolition of the Navy and highly
disapproved of Jefferson, both as an individual and as a statesman.
They belonged to the old school of Federalists. Three more upright
men did not live.</p></div>

<h3>WHAT IS TREASON?</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses
to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. (Constitution, Article III,
Section 3.)</p>

<p>Such are the jealous provisions of our laws in favor of the accused that I question
if he can be convicted. (Jefferson.)</p>

<p>The scenes which have passed and those about to be transacted will hereafter
be deemed fables, unless attested by very high authority. (Aaron Burr.)</p>

<p>That this court dares not usurp power is most true. That this court dares not
shrink from its duty is no less true. (Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>While the grand jury had been examining witnesses,
interesting things had taken place in Richmond.
Burr's friends increased in number and devotion.
Many of them accompanied him to and from
court each day.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> Dinners were given in his honor,
and Burr returned these courtesies, sometimes entertaining
at his board a score of men and women of
the leading families of the city.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> Fashionable Richmond
was rapidly becoming Burr-partisan. In society,
as at the bar, the Government had been maneuvered
into defense. Throughout the country,
indeed, Burr's numerous adherents had proved
stanchly loyal to him.</p>

<p>"I believe," notes Senator Plumer in his diary,
"even at this period, that no man in this country,
has more personal friends or who are more firmly
attached to his interests&mdash;or would make greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
sacrifices to aid him than this man."<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> But this
availed Burr nothing as against the opinion of the
multitude, which Jefferson manipulated as he chose.
Indeed, save in Richmond, this very fidelity of Burr's
friends served rather to increase the public animosity;
for many of these friends were persons of standing,
and this fact did not appeal favorably to the
rank and file of the rampant democracy of the period.</p>

<p>In Richmond, however, Burr's presence and visible
peril animated his followers to aggressive action.
On the streets, in the taverns and drinking-places,
his adherents grew bolder. Young Swartwout
chanced to meet the bulky, epauletted Wilkinson on
the sidewalk. Flying into "a paroxysm of disgust
and rage," Burr's youthful follower<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> shouldered the
burly general "into the middle of the street." Wilkinson
swallowed the insult. On learning of the
incident Jackson "was wild with delight."<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> Burr's
enemies were as furious with anger. To spirited
Virginians, only treason itself was worse than the
refusal of Wilkinson, thus insulted, to fight.</p>

<p>Swartwout, perhaps inspired by Jackson, later
confirmed this public impression of Wilkinson's
cowardice. He challenged the General to a duel; the
hero refused&mdash;"he held no correspondence with
traitors or conspirators," he loftily observed;<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>
whereupon the young "conspirator and traitor"
denounced, in the public press, the commander of
the American armies as guilty of treachery, perjury,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
forgery, and cowardice.<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> The highest officer in the
American military establishment "posted for cowardice"
by a mere stripling! More than ever was
Swartwout endeared to Jackson.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival at Richmond, and a week
before Burr was indicted, Wilkinson perceived, to
his dismay, the current of public favor that was beginning
to run toward Burr; and he wrote to Jefferson
in unctuous horror: "I had anticipated that a
deluge of Testimony would have been poured forth
from all quarters, to overwhelm Him [Burr] with
guilt &amp; dishonour&mdash;... To my Astonishment I found
the Traitor vindicated &amp; myself condemned by a
Mass of Wealth Character-influence &amp; Talents&mdash;merciful
God what a Spectacle did I behold&mdash;Integrity
&amp; Truth perverted &amp; trampled under foot
by turpitude &amp; Guilt, Patriotism appaled &amp; Usurpation
triumphant."<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson was plainly weakening, and Jefferson
hastened to comfort his chief witness: "No one is
more sensible than myself of the injustice which has
been aimed at you. Accept I pray, my salutations
and assurances of respect and esteem."<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the grand jury had indicted Burr and
Blennerhassett, Wilkinson suffered another humiliation.
On the very day that the General sent his wailing
cry of outraged virtue to the President, Burr
gave notice that he would move that an attachment
should issue against Jefferson's hero for "contempt
in obstructing the administration of justice" by
rifling the mails, imprisoning witnesses, and extorting
testimony by torture.<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> The following day was
consumed in argument upon the motion that did
not rise far above bickering. Marshall ruled that witnesses
should be heard in support of Burr's application,
and that Wilkinson ought to be present.<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> Accordingly,
the General was ordered to come into court.</p>

<p>James Knox, one of the young men who had accompanied
Burr on his disastrous expedition, had
been brought from New Orleans as a witness for
the Government. He told a straightforward story
of brutality inflicted upon him because he could not
readily answer the printed questions sent out by
Jefferson's Attorney-General.<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> By other witnesses
it appeared that letters had been improperly taken
from the post-office in New Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> An argument
followed in which counsel on both sides distinguished
themselves by the learning and eloquence they displayed.<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a></p>

<p>It was while Botts was speaking on this motion to
attach Wilkinson, that the grand jury returned the
bills of indictment.<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> So came the dramatic climax.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly the argument over the attachment of
Wilkinson was suspended. Burr said that he would
"prove that the indictment against him had been
obtained by perjury"; and that this was a reason for
the court to exercise its discretion in his favor and
to accept bail instead of imprisoning him.<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> Marshall
asked Martin whether he had "any precedent,
where a court has bailed for treason, after the finding
of a grand jury," when "the testimony ... had been
impeached for perjury," or new testimony had been
presented to the court.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> For once in his life, Martin
could not answer immediately and offhand. So that
night Aaron Burr slept in the common jail at Richmond.</p>

<p>"The cup of bitterness has been administered to
him with unsparing hand," wrote Washington Irving.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>
But he did not quail. He was released next
morning upon a writ of habeas corpus;<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> the argument
on the request for the attachment of Wilkinson
was resumed, and for three days counsel attacked
and counter-attacked.<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> On June 26, Burr's attorneys
made oath that confinement in the city jail was endangering
his health; also that they could not, under
such conditions, properly consult with him about
the conduct of his case. Accordingly, Marshall ordered
Burr removed to the house occupied by Luther
Martin; and to be confined to the front room,
with the window shutters secured by bars, the door
by a padlock, and the building guarded by seven
men. Burr pleaded not guilty to the indictments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
against him, and orders were given for summoning
the jury to try him.<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a></p>

<p>Finally, Marshall delivered his written opinion
upon the motion to attach Wilkinson. It was unimportant,
and held that Wilkinson had not been
shown to have influenced the judge who ordered
Knox imprisoned or to have violated the laws intentionally.
The Chief Justice ordered the marshal
to summon, in addition to the general panel, forty-eight
men to appear on August 3 from Wood
County, in which Blennerhassett's island was located,
and where the indictment charged that the
crime had been committed.<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a></p>

<p>Five days before Marshall adjourned court in
order that jurymen might be summoned and both
prosecution and defense enabled to prepare for
trial, an event occurred which proved, as nothing
else could have done, how intent were the people on
the prosecution of Burr, how unshakable the tenacity
with which Jefferson pursued him.</p>

<p>On June 22, 1807, the British warship, the Leopard,
halted the American frigate, the Chesapeake, as
the latter was putting out to sea from Norfolk. The
British officers demanded of Commodore James
Barron to search the American ship for British deserters
and to take them if found. Barron refused.
Thereupon the Leopard, having drawn alongside the
American vessel, without warning poured broadsides
into her until her masts were shot away, her rigging
destroyed, three sailors killed and eighteen wounded.
The Chesapeake had not been fitted out, was unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
to reply, and finally was forced to strike her colors.
The British officers then came on board and seized
the men they claimed as deserters, all but one of
whom were American-born citizens.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a></p>

<p>The whole country, except New England, roared
with anger when the news reached the widely separated
sections of it; but the tempest soon spent its
fury. Quickly the popular clamor returned to the
"traitor" awaiting trial at Richmond. Nor did this
"enormity," as Jefferson called the attack on the
Chesapeake,<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> committed by a foreign power in
American waters, weaken for a moment the President's
determination to punish the native disturber
of our domestic felicity.</p>

<p>The news of the Chesapeake outrage arrived at
Richmond on June 25, and John Randolph supposed
that, of course, Jefferson would immediately call
Congress in special session.<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> The President did
nothing of the kind. Wilkinson, as Commander of
the Army, advised him against armed retaliation.
The "late outrage by the British," wrote the General,
"has produced ... a degree of Emotion bordering
on rage&mdash;I revere the Honourable impulse but
fear its Effects&mdash;... The present is no moment for
precipitancy or a stretch of power&mdash;on the contrary
the British being prepared for War &amp; we not, a sudden
appeal to hostilities will give them a great advantage&mdash;... The
efforts made here [Richmond] by a
band of depraved Citizens, in conjunction with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
audacious phalanx of insolent exotics, to save Burr,
will have an ultimate good Effect, for the national
Character of the <i>Ancient dominion</i> is in display, and
the honest impulses of true patriotism will soon
silence the advocates of usurpation without &amp; conspiracy
within."</p>

<p>Wilkinson tells Jefferson that he is coming to
Washington forthwith to pay his "respects," and
concludes: "You are doubtless well advised of proceedings
here in the case of Burr&mdash;to me they are
incomprehensible as I am no Jurist&mdash;The Grand
Jury actually made an attempt to present me for
Misprision of Treason&mdash;... I feel myself between
'Scylla and Carybdis' the Jury would Dishonor me
for failing of my Duty, and Burr &amp; his Conspirators
for performing it&mdash;"<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p>Not until five weeks after the Chesapeake affair
did the President call Congress to convene in special
session on October 26&mdash;more than four months
after the occurrence of the crisis it was summoned to
consider.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> But in the meantime Jefferson had sent a
messenger to advise the American Minister in London
to tell the British Government what had happened,
and to demand a disavowal and an apology.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Administration vigorously pushed
the prosecution of the imprisoned "traitor" at
Richmond.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> Hay was dissatisfied that Burr should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
remain in Martin's house, even under guard and
with windows barred and door locked; and he obtained
from the Executive Council of Virginia a
tender to the court of "apartments on the third
floor" of the State Penitentiary for the incarceration
of the prisoner. Burr's counsel strenuously objected,
but Marshall ordered that he be confined
there until August 2, at which time he should be
returned to the barred and padlocked room in
Martin's house.<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a></p>

<p>In the penitentiary, "situated in a solitary place
among the hills" a mile and a half from Richmond,<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>
Burr remained for five weeks. Three large rooms
were given him in the third story; the jailer was considerate
and kind; his friends called on him every
day;<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> and servants constantly "arrived with messages,
notes, and inquiries, bringing oranges, lemons,
pineapples, raspberries, apricots, cream, butter,
ice and some ordinary articles."<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<p>Burr wrote Theodosia of his many visitors,
women as well as men: "It is well that I have an
ante-chamber, or I should often be <i>g&ecirc;n&eacute;</i> with visitors."
If Theodosia should come on for the trial, he
playfully admonishes her that there must be "no
agitations, no complaints, no fears or anxieties on
the road, or I renounce thee."<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a></p>

<p>Finally Burr asked his daughter to come to him:
"I want an independent and discerning witness to
my conduct and that of the government. The scenes
which have passed and those about to be transacted
will exceed all reasonable credibility, and will hereafter
be deemed fables, unless attested by very high
authority.... I should never invite any one, much
less those so dear to me, to witness my disgrace. I
may be immured in dungeons, chained, murdered in
legal form, but I cannot be humiliated or disgraced.
If absent, you will suffer great solicitude. In my
presence you will feel none, whatever be the <i>malice</i>
or the <i>power</i> of my enemies, and in both they
abound."<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a></p>

<p>Theodosia was soon with her father. Her husband,
Joseph Alston, now Governor of South Carolina,
accompanied her; and she brought her little
son, who, almost as much as his beautiful mother,
was the delight of Burr's heart.</p>

<p>During these torrid weeks the public temper
throughout the country rose with the thermometer.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
The popular distrust of Marshall grew into open
hostility. A report of the proceedings, down to the
time when Burr was indicted for treason, was published
in a thick pamphlet and sold all over Virginia
and neighboring States. The impression which the
people thus acquired was that Marshall was protecting
Burr; for had he not refused to imprison him
until the grand jury indicted the "traitor"?</p>

<p>The Chief Justice estimated the situation accurately.
He knew, moreover, that prosecutions for
treason might be instituted thereafter in other parts
of the country, particularly in New England. The
Federalist leaders in that section had already spoken
and written sentiments as disloyal, essentially, as
those now attributed to Burr; and, at that very
time, when the outcry against Burr was loudest, they
were beginning to revive their project of seceding
from the Union.<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> To so excellent a politician and so
far-seeing a statesman as Marshall, it must have
seemed probable that his party friends in New England
might be brought before the courts to answer
to the same charge as that against Aaron Burr.</p>

<p>At all events, he took, at this time, a wise and
characteristically prudent step. Four days after the
news of the Chesapeake affair reached Richmond,
the Chief Justice asked his associates on the Supreme
Bench for their opinion on the law of treason as pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>sented
in the case of Aaron Burr. "I am aware,"
he wrote, "of the unwillingness with which a judge
will commit himself by an opinion on a case not
before him, and on which he has heard no argument.
Could this case be readily carried before the Supreme
Court, I would not ask an opinion in its present
stage. But these questions must be decided
by the judges separately on their respective circuits,
and I am sure that there would be a strong and
general repugnance to giving contradictory decisions
on the same points. Such a circumstance would be
disreputable to the judges themselves as well as to
our judicial system. This suggestion suggests the
propriety of a consultation on new and different
subjects and will, I trust, apologize for this letter."<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a></p>

<p>Whether a consultation was held during the five
weeks that the Burr trial was suspended is not known.
But if the members of the Supreme Court did not
meet the Chief Justice, it would appear to be certain
that they wrote him their views of the American law
of treason; and that, in the crucial opinion which
Marshall delivered on that subject more than two
months after he had written to his associates, he
stated their mature judgments as well as his own.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a composure, unwonted
even for him, that Marshall again opened court on
August 3, 1807. The crowd was, if possible, greater
than ever. Burr entered the hall with his son-in-law,
Governor Alston.<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> Not until a week later was coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>sel
for the Government ready to proceed. When at
last the men summoned to serve on the petit jury
were examined as to their qualifications, it was all
but impossible to find one impartial man among
them&mdash;utterly impossible to secure one who had
not formed opinions from what, for months, had
been printed in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Marshall described with fairness the indispensable
qualifications of a juror.<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> Men were rejected as
fast as they were questioned&mdash;all had read the stories
and editorial opinions that had filled the press,
and had accepted the deliberate judgment of Jefferson
and the editors; also, they had been impressed
by the public clamor thus created, and believed
Burr guilty of treason. Out of forty-eight men examined
during the first day, only four could be
accepted.<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a></p>

<p>While the examination of jurors was in progress,
one of the most brilliant debates of the entire trial
sprang up, as to the nature and extent of opinions
formed which would exclude a man from serving on
a jury.<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a></p>

<p>When Marshall was ready to deliver his opinion,
he had heard all the reasoning that great lawyers
could give on the subject, and had listened to acute
analyses of all the authorities. His statement of the
law was the ablest opinion he had yet delivered during
the proceedings, and is an admirable example of
his best logical method. It appears, however, to have
been unnecessary, and was doubtless delivered as a
part of Marshall's carefully considered plan to go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
the extreme throughout the trial in the hearing and
examination of every subject.<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p>For nearly two weeks the efforts to select a jury
continued. Not until August 15 were twelve men
secured, and most of these avowed that they had
formed opinions that Burr was a traitor. They were
accepted only because impartial men could not be
found.</p>

<p>When Marshall finished the reading of his opinion,
Hay promptly advised Jefferson that "the [bi]as of
Judge Marshall is as obvious, as if it was [stam]ped
upon his forehead.... [He is] endeavoring to work
himself up to a state of [f]eeling which will enable
[him] to aid Burr throughout the trial, without appearing
to be conscious of doing wrong. He [Marshall]
seems to think that his reputation is irretrievably
gone, and that he has now nothing to lose by
doing as he pleases.&mdash;His concern for Burr is wonderful.
He told me many years ago, when Burr was
rising in the estimation of the republican party, that
he was as profligate in principle, as he was desperate
in fortune. I remember his words. They astonished
me.</p>

<p>"Yet," complained Hay, "when the Gr: Jury
brought in their bill the Chief Justice gazed at him,
for a long time, without appearing conscious that
he was doing so, with an expression of sympathy
&amp; sorrow as strong, as the human countenance can
exhibit without <i>palpable</i> emotion. If Mr. Burr has
any feeling left, yesterday must have been a day of
agonizing humiliation," because the answers of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
jurors had been uniformly against him; and Hay
gleefully relates specimens of them.</p>

<p>"There is but one chance for the accused," he
continued, "and that is a good one because it rests
with the Chief Justice. It is already hinted, but not
by himself [that] the decision of the Supreme Court
will no[t be] deemed binding. If the assembly of
men on [Blennerhassett's is]land, can be pronounced
'not an overt act' [it will] be so pronounced."<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a></p>

<p>Hay's opening statement to the jury was his best
performance of the entire proceedings. He described
Burr's purpose in almost the very words of
Jefferson's Special Message. The gathering on Blennerhassett's
island was, he said, the overt act; Burr,
it was true, was not there at the time, but his presence
was not necessary. Had not Marshall, in the
Bollmann and Swartwout case, said that "if war be
actually levied, ... <i>all those who perform any part,
however minute</i>, or <i>however remote from the scene of
action</i>, and who are actually <i>leagued in the general
conspiracy, are to be considered</i> as <i>traitors</i>"?<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a></p>

<p>The examination of the Government's witnesses
began. Eaton took the stand; but Burr insisted that
the overt act must be proved before collateral testimony
could be admitted. So came the first crossing
of swords over the point that was to save the life of
Aaron Burr. The arguments of counsel were brilliant;
but neither side forgot the public. They must
thrill the audience as well as convince the court.
"There had been a great deal of war in the news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>papers,"
said Wickham, but everybody knew "that
there had been no war in fact." Wirt insisted on
"unfolding events as they occurred"; that was "the
lucid order of nature and reason." Martin pointed
out that Eaton's testimony did not "relate to any
<i>acts</i> committed any where, but to mere declarations
out of the district."<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> Let the evidence be pertinent.
The indictment charged a specific act, and it must
be proved as charged. No man could be expected
suddenly to answer for every act of his life. If Burr
had planned to free Mexico and had succeeded, "he
would have merited the applause of the friends of
liberty and of posterity; ... but his friends may now
pray that he may not meet the fate that Washington
himself would have met, if the revolution had not
been established."</p>

<p>A mass of decisions, English as well as American,
were cited by both Wirt and Martin;<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> and when,
that night, Marshall began to write his opinion on
whether the overt act must be proved before other
testimony could be received, all authorities had
been reviewed, all arguments made.</p>

<p>Must the overt act be proved before hearing collateral
testimony? The question, said Marshall, was
precisely the same as that raised and decided on the
motion to commit Burr. But it came up now under
different circumstances&mdash;an indictment had been
found "specifying a charge which is to be proved,"
and thus "an issue made up which presents a point
to which all the testimony must apply." So Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>shall
could now "determine, with some accuracy, on
the relevancy of the testimony."</p>

<p>The prosecution contended that the crime consisted
of "the fact and the intention," and that the
Government might first prove either of these; the
defense insisted that the overt act must be shown
before any testimony, explanatory or confirmatory
of that fact, can be received. To prove first the fact
charged was certainly "the most useful ... and ...
natural order of testimony"; but no fixed rule of
evidence required it, and no case had been cited in
which any court had ever "forced" it on counsel
for the prosecution.</p>

<p>The different impressions made upon the minds
of the jury by the order of testimony was important,
said Marshall: "Although human laws punish actions,
the human mind spontaneously attaches guilt
to intentions." When testimony had prepared the
mind to look upon the prisoner's designs as criminal,
a jury would consider a fact in a different light than
if it had been proved before guilty intentions had
been shown. However, since no rule prevented the
prosecution from first proving either, "no alteration
of that arrangement ... will now be directed."</p>

<p>But, continued Marshall, "the intention which
is ... relevant in this stage of the inquiry is the intention
which composes a part of the crime, the
intention with which the overt act itself was committed;
not a general evil disposition, or an intention
to commit a distinct [different] fact." Testimony
as to such intentions, "if admissible at all,
is received as corroborative or confirmatory testi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>mony,"
and could not precede "that which it is to
corroborate or confirm."</p>

<p>Apply this rule to Eaton's testimony: it would be
admissible only "so far as his testimony relate[d]
to the fact charged in the indictment, ... to levying
war on Blennerhassett's island," and the "design to
seize on New-Orleans, or to separate by force, the
western from the Atlantic states"; but "so far as it
respect[ed] other plans to be executed in the city of
Washington, or elsewhere," Eaton's story would be
at best merely "corroborative testimony," and, "if
admissible at any time," could be received only
"after hearing that which it is to confirm."</p>

<p>So let Hay "proceed according to his own judgment."
Marshall would not exclude any testimony
except that which appeared to be irrelevant, and
upon this he would decide when it was offered.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<p>Again Eaton was called to the stand. Before he
began his tale, he wished to explain "the motives"
of his "own conduct." Marshall blandly suggested
that the witness stick to Burr's revelations to him.
Then, said Eaton, "concerning any overt act, which
goes to prove Aaron Burr guilty of treason I know
nothing.... But concerning Colonel Burr's expressions
of treasonable intentions, I know much."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Marshall's intimation that Eaton
must confine his testimony to Burr, "the hero
of Derne" was not to be denied his self-vindication;
not even the Chief Justice should check his recital
of his patriotism, his glories, his wrongs. Burr had
good reasons for supposing him "disaffected toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
the Government"; he then related at length his
services in Africa, the lack of appreciation of his
ability and heroism, the preferment of unworthy
men to the neglect of himself. Finally, Eaton, who
"strutted more in buskin than usual," to the amusement
of "the whole court,"<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> delivered his testimony,
and once more related what he had said in
his deposition. Since Marshall had "decided it to
be irrelevant," Eaton omitted the details about
Burr's plans to murder Jefferson, turn Congress out
of the Capitol, seize the Navy, and make himself
ruler of America at one bold and bloody stroke.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>Commodore Truxtun then gave the simple and
direct account, already related, of Burr's conversation
with him;<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> Peter Taylor and Jacob Allbright
once more told their strange tales; and the three
Morgans again narrated the incidents of Burr's
incredible acts and statements while visiting the
elder Morgan at Morganza.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p>William Love, an Englishman, formerly Blennerhassett's
servant&mdash;a dull, ignorant, and timorous
creature&mdash;testified to the gathering of "<i>about betwixt</i>
twenty and twenty-five" men at his employer's
island, some of whom went "out a gunning." He
saw no other arms except those belonging to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
master, nor did he "see any guns presented," as Allbright
had described. Blennerhassett told him that
if he would go with him to the Washita, he should
have "a piece of land." Love "understood the object
of the expedition was to settle Washita lands."<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a></p>

<p>Dudley Woodbridge, once a partner of Blennerhassett,
told of Burr's purchase from his firm of a
hundred barrels of pork and fifteen boats, paid by
a draft on Ogden of New York; of Blennerhassett's
short conversation with Woodbridge about the enterprise,
from which he inferred that "the object
was Mexico"; of his settlement with Blennerhassett
of their partnership accounts; of Blennerhassett's
financial resources; and of the characteristics of the
man&mdash;"very nearsighted," ignorant of military
affairs, a literary person, a chemist and musician,
with the reputation of having "every kind of sense
but common sense."</p>

<p>The witness related his observation of the seizure
at Marietta of Burr's few boats and provisions by
the Ohio militia, and the sale of them by the Government;
of the assemblage of the twenty or thirty
men on Blennerhassett's island; of their quiet, orderly
conduct; of Comfort Tyler's declaration "that
he would not resist the constituted authorities, but
that he would not be stopped by a mob"; of Mrs.
Blennerhassett's taking part of her husband's library
with her when she followed him, after the flight
of the terrified little band from the island; and of the
sale of the remainder of the cultivated visionary's
books.<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>Simeon Poole, who had been sent by Governor
Tiffin of Ohio to arrest Blennerhassett, said that he
was not on the island, but from dusk until ten o'clock
watched from a concealed place on the Ohio shore.
He saw a few men walking about, who during the
night kindled a fire, by the light of which it seemed
to Poole that some of them were "armed." He
could not be sure from where he watched, but they
"looked like sentinels." However, Poole "could
not say whether the persons ... were not merely
loitering around the fire." There were some boats,
he said, both big and little. Also, when anybody
wanted to cross from the Ohio side, the acute Poole
thought that "a watchword" was given. The night
was cold, the rural sleuth admitted, and it was customary
to build fires on the river-bank. He observed,
however, another suspicious circumstance&mdash;"lanterns
were passing ... between the house and
boats.... Most of the people were without guns," he
admitted; but, although he could not see clearly, he
"apprehended that some of them had guns."<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a></p>

<p>Morris P. Belknap, an Ohio business man, testified
that he had hailed a boat and been taken to the
island on the night when the gathering and flight
took place.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> He saw perhaps twenty men in the
house; "two or three ... near the door, had rifles,
and appeared to be cleaning them. These were all
the arms I saw." He also observed two or three
boats.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

<p>Edmund P. Dana testified that, with two other
young men, he had gone in a skiff to the island on
that war-levying night.<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> In the hall he saw about
"fifteen or sixteen" men&mdash;"one of them was running
some bullets." Dana was shown to another
room where he met "colonel Tyler, Blennerhassett,
Mr. Smith of New-York ... and three or four other
gentlemen." He had met Tyler the day before, and
was now "introduced to Mr. Smith and Doctor
M'Castle<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> who had his lady ... there." The men in
the hall "did not appear to be alarmed" when Dana
and his companions came in. Dana "never saw
colonel Burr on the island."<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>The Government's counsel admitted that Burr
was in Kentucky at that time.<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a></p>

<p>Such was the testimony, and the whole of it, adduced
to support the charge that Burr had, at Blennerhassett's
island, on December 13, 1806, levied
war against the United States. Such was the entire
proof of that overt act as laid in the indictment
when Marshall was called upon to make that momentous
decision upon which the fate of Aaron Burr
depended.</p>

<p>The defense moved that, since no overt act was
proved as charged, collateral testimony as to what
had been said and done elsewhere should not be
received. Wickham opened the argument in an
address worthy of that historic occasion. For nearly
two days this superb lawyer spoke. Burr's counsel
would, he said, have preferred to go on, for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
could "adduce ... conclusive testimony" as to Burr's
innocence. But only seven witnesses out of "about
one hundred and forty" summoned by the Government
had been examined, and it was admitted that
these seven had given all the testimony in existence
to prove the overt act.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="596" height="800" alt="John Wickham" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>John Wickham</i></span>
</div>

<p>If that overt act had not been established and yet
the more than one hundred and thirty remaining
witnesses were to be examined, it was manifest that
"weeks, perhaps months," would elapse before the
Government completed its case. It was the unhealthy
season, and it was most probable that one
or more jurors would become ill. If so, said Wickham,
"the cause must lie over and our client, innocent,
may be subjected to a prolongation of that
confinement which is in itself ... punishment." Yet,
after all this suffering, expense, and delay, the
result must be the same as if the evidence were
arrested now, since there was no testimony to the
overt act other than that already given.</p>

<p>Did that testimony, then, prove the overt act of
levying war on the United States? Those who wrote
the Constitution "well knew the dreadful punishments
inflicted and the grievous oppressions produced
by [the doctrine of] constructive treasons in
other countries." For this reason, truly declared
Wickham, the American Constitution explicitly defined
that crime and prescribed the only way it could
be proved. This could not be modified by the
common law, since the United States, as a Nation,
had not adopted it; and the purpose of the Constitution
was to destroy, as far as America was concerned,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
the British theory of treason. The Constitution
"explains itself," said Wickham; under it treason is
a newly created offense against a newly created government.
Even the Government's counsel "will not
contend that the words [in the Constitution concerning
treason] used in their natural sense," can
embrace the case of a person who never committed
an act of hostility against the United States and
was not even present when one was committed;<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>
otherwise what horrible cruelties any Administration
could inflict on any American citizen.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, in the case of Bollmann and
Swartwout, had, indeed, pronounced a "<i>dictum</i>" to
the contrary, said Wickham, but that had been in
a mere case of commitment; the present point did
not then come before the court; it was not argued
by counsel. So Marshall's objectionable language
in that case was not authority.<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p>It was only by the doctrine of constructive treason
that Burr could be said to be at Blennerhassett's
island at the time charged&mdash;the doctrine that "in
treason all are principals," and that, by "construction
of law," he was present, although in reality he
was hundreds of miles away. But this was the very
doctrine which the Constitution prohibited from
ever being applied in America.</p>

<p>If Burr "conspired to levy war against the United
States, and ... the war was carried on by others in
his absence, his offense can only be punished by <i>a
special indictment charging the facts as they existed</i>."
The prosecution "should at once withdraw their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
indictment as it does not contain a specification that
can be supported by the evidence."<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a></p>

<p>Edmund Randolph followed Wickham, but added
nothing to his rich and solid argument. Addressing
Marshall personally, Randolph exclaimed: "Amidst
all the difficulties of the trial, I congratulate Your
Honour on having the opportunity of fixing the law,
relative to this peculiar crime, on grounds which will
not deceive, and with such regard for human rights,
that we shall bless the day on which the sentence
was given, to prevent the fate of Stafford."<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a></p>

<p>When Randolph closed, on Friday, August 21,
Hay asked Marshall to postpone further discussion
until Monday, that counsel for the Government
might prepare their arguments.<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> Burr's attorneys
stoutly objected, but Marshall wisely granted Hay's
request.<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> "Did you not do an unprecedented thing,"
a friend asked Marshall, "in suspending a criminal
prosecution and granting two days, in the midst of
the argument on a point then under discussion, for
counsel to get ready to speak upon it?" "Yes,"
replied the Chief Justice, "I did and I knew it. But
if I had not done so I should have been reproached
with not being <i>disposed</i> to give the prosecutors an
opportunity to answer."<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a></p>

<p>Saturday and Sunday were more than time enough
to light the fires of MacRae's Scotch wrath. His
anger dominated him to such an extent that he
became almost incoherent.<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> Burr not a principal!
"Let all who are in any manner concerned in treason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
be principals," and treason will be suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> MacRae,
speaking the language of Jeffreys, had, in his
rage, forgotten that he had immigrated to America.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, August 25, although the court
opened at nine o'clock,<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> the heat was so oppressive
that nothing but the public interest&mdash;now reaching
the point of hysteria&mdash;could have kept the densely
packed audience in the stifling hall.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> But the spectators
soon forgot their discomfort. The youthful,
handsome William Wirt enraptured them with an
eloquence which has lived for a century. It is impossible
to give a faithful condensation of this
charming and powerful address, the mingled courtesy
and boldness of it, the apt phrase, the effective
imagery, the firm logic, the wealth of learning. Only
examples can be presented; and these do scant justice
to the young lawyer's speech.</p>

<p>"When we speak of treason, we must call it treason....
Why then are gentlemen so sensitive ... as if
instead of a hall of justice, we were in a drawing-room
with colonel Burr, and were barbarously violating
towards him every principle of decorum and
humanity?<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> This motion [to arrest the testimony]
is a bold and original stroke in the noble science of
defence," made to prevent the hearing of the evidence.
But he knew that Marshall would not "sacrifice
public justice, committed to [his] charge, by
aiding this stratagem to elude the sentence of the
law."<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<p>Why had Wickham said so little of American and
so much of British precedents, vanishing "like a
spirit from American ground and ... resurging by a
kind of intellectual magic in the middle of the 16th
century, complaining most dolefully of my lord
Coke's bowels." It was to get as far as possible away
from Marshall's decision in the case of Bollmann and
Swartwout. If Marshall's opinion had been favorable,
Wickham "would not have ... deserted a rock
so broad and solid, to walk upon the waves of the
Atlantic." Wirt made the most of Marshall's careless
language.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a></p>

<p>The youthful advocate was impressing Marshall as
well as jury and auditors. "Do you mean to say,"
asked the Chief Justice, "that it is not necessary to
state in the indictment in what manner the accused,
who it is admitted was absent, became connected
with the acts on Blennerhassett's island?" In reply
Wirt condensed the theory of the prosecution: "I
mean to say, that the <i>count</i> is <i>general</i> in modern
cases; that we are endeavoring to make the accused
a traitor by connection, by stating the act which was
done, and which act, from his conduct in the transaction,
he made his own; that it is sufficient to make
this charge generally, not only because it is authorized
by the constitutional definition, but because it
is conformable to modern cases, in which the indictments
are pruned of all needless luxuriances."<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<p>Burr's presence at the island necessary! If so, a
man might devise and set in motion "the whole
mechanism" of treason, "go a hundred miles" away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
let it be operated by his agents, "and he is innocent,
... while those whom he has deluded are to suffer the
death of traitors." How infamous! Burr only the
accessory and Blennerhassett the principal! "Will
any man believe that Burr who is a soldier bold,
ardent, restless and aspiring, the great actor whose
brain conceived and whose hand brought the plot
into operation, should sink down into an accessory
and Blennerhassett be elevated into a principal!"</p>

<p>Here Wirt delivered that passage which for nearly
a hundred years was to be printed in American
schoolbooks, declaimed by American youth, and to
become second only to Jefferson's Proclamation,
Messages, and letters, in fixing, perhaps irremovably,
public opinion as to Aaron Burr and Harman Blennerhassett.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>
But his speech was not all rhetoric.
Indeed, no advocate on either side, except John
Wickham and Luther Martin, approached him in
analyses of authorities and closeness of reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a></p>

<p>"I cannot promise you, sir, a speech manufactured
out of tropes and figures," remarked Botts in
beginning his reply. No man better could have been
found to break the force of the address of his young
brother of the bar. Wirt had defaced his otherwise
well-nigh perfect address by the occasional use of
extravagant rhetoric, some of which, it appears, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
not reported. Botts availed himself of one such display
to make Wirt's argument seem absurd and
trivial: "Instead of the introduction of a sleeping
Venus with all the luxury of voluptuous and wanton
nakedness to charm the reason through the refined
medium of sensuality, and to convince us that the
law of treason is with the prosecution by leading
our imaginations to the fascinating richness ... of
heaving bosom and luscious waist, I am compelled
to plod heavily and meekly through the dull doctrines
of Hale and Foster." Botts continued, with
daring but brilliant satire, to ridicule Wirt's unhappy
rhetoric.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> Soon spectators, witnesses, jury,
were in laughter. The older lawyers were vastly
amused. Even Marshall openly enjoyed the humor.</p>

<p>His purpose thus accomplished, Botts now addressed
himself to the evidence, to analyze which he
had been assigned. And a perfect job he made of it.
He spoke with impetuous rapidity.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> He reviewed the
events at Blennerhassett's island: "There <i>was war</i>,
when there was confessedly no war; and it happened
although it was prevented!" As to arms: "No arms
were necessary ... they might make war with their
fingers." Yes, yes, "a most bloody war indeed&mdash;and
ten or twelve boats." Referring to the flight
from Blennerhassett's island, the sarcastic lawyer
observed: "If I run away and hide to avoid a beating
I am guilty and may be convicted of assault and
battery!" What "simpletons" the people of Kentucky
and Mississippi had been! "They hunted but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
could not find the war," although there it was, right
among them!<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a></p>

<p>What was the moving force back of the prosecution?
It was, charged Botts, the rescue of the prestige
of Jefferson's Administration. "It has not only
been said here but published in all the newspapers
throughout the United States, that if Aaron Burr
should be acquitted it will be the severest satire on
the government; and that the people are called upon
to support the government by the conviction of
colonel Burr; ... even jurymen have been taught by
the common example to insult him."</p>

<p>No lie was too contemptible to be published about
him. For instance, "when the grand jury returned a
true bill, he was firm, serene, unmoved, composed&mdash;no
change of countenance.... Yet the next day
they announced in the newspapers," declared Botts,
"that he was in a state of indescribable consternation
and dismay." Worse still, "every man who
dares to look at the accused with a smile or present
him the hand of friendship" is "denounced as a
traitor."<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a></p>

<p>Black but faithful was the picture the fearless
lawyer drew of the Government's conduct.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> He
dwelt on the devices resorted to for inflaming the
people against Burr, and after they had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
aroused, the demand that public sentiment be
heeded and the accused convicted. Was that the
method of justice! If so, where was the boasted
beneficence of democracies? Where the righteousness
and wisdom of the people? What did history
tell us of the justice or mercy of the people? It was
the people who forced Socrates to drink hemlock,
banished Aristides, compelled the execution of Admiral
Byng. "Jefferson was run down in 1780<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> by
the voice of the people." If the law of constructive
treason were to be adopted in America and courts
were to execute the will of the people, alas for any
man, however upright and innocent, whom public
opinion had been falsely led to condemn.<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<p>Hay, who had been ill for several days<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> and was
badly worn, spoke heavily for the greater part of
two days.<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> His address, though dull, was creditable;
but he added nothing in thought or authorities to
Wirt's great speech. His principal point, which he
repeated interminably, was that the jury must decide
both law and fact. In making this contention
he declared that Marshall was now asked by Burr's
counsel to do the very thing for which Chase had
been impeached.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> Time and again the District Attorney
insinuated that impeachment would be Marshall's
fate if he did not permit the jury to hear all
the testimony.<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a></p>

<p>Charles Lee, Attorney-General under President<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
Adams, and an intimate friend of Marshall,<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> had
joined Burr's legal forces some time before. In opening
his otherwise dry argument, Lee called Marshall's
attention to Hay's threat of impeachment.
The exhausted District Attorney finally denied that
he meant such a thing, and Marshall mildly observed:
"I did not consider you as making any personal
allusion, but as merely referring to the law."<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>
Thus, with his kindly tactfulness, Marshall put the
incident aside.</p>

<p>On August 28, Luther Martin closed the debate.
He had been drinking even more than usual throughout
the proceedings;<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> but never was he in more
perfect command of all his wonderful powers. No
outline of his address will be attempted; but a few
quotations may be illustrative.</p>

<p>It was the admitted legal right and "indispensable
duty" of Burr's counsel, began Martin, to make
the motion to arrest the testimony; yet for doing so
"we have been denounced throughout the United
States as attempting to suppress the truth." Our
act "has been held up to the public and to this jury
as conclusive proof of our guilt." Such, declared
the great lawyer, were the methods used to convict
Burr.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> He had been in favor, he avowed, of waiving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
"obvious and undeniable rights," and of going on
with the trial because he was convinced that all the
evidence would not only clear "his friend," but remove
the groundless prejudices which had so wickedly
been excited against Burr. But he had yielded
to the judgment of his associates that the plan
adopted was more conformable to law.</p>

<p>"I shall ever feel the sincerest gratitude to heaven,
that my life has been preserved to this time, and
that I am enabled to appear ... in his defense." And
if his fellow counsel and himself should be "successful
in rescuing a gentleman, for whom I with pleasure
avow my friendship and esteem, from the fangs of
his persecutors ... what dear delight will my heart
enjoy!"<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> Martin thanked Heaven, too, for the boon
of being permitted to oppose the "destructive" doctrine
of treason advanced by the Government. For
hours he analyzed the British decisions which he
"thanked God ... are not binding authority in this
country." He described the origin and growth of the
doctrine of constructive treason and defined it with
clearness and precision.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> It was admitted that Burr
was not actually present at the time and place at
which the indictment charged him with having committed
the crime; but, according to the Government,
he was "constructively" present.</p>

<p>With perfect fearlessness Martin attacked Marshall's
objectionable language in the Bollmann and
Swartwout opinion from the Supreme Bench: "As
a binding judicial opinion," he accurately declared,
"it ought to have no more weight than the ballad of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
Chevy Chase."<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> Deftly he impressed upon Marshall,
Hay's threat of impeachment if the Chief Justice
should presume to decide in Burr's favor.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> Lamenting
the popular hostility toward Burr, Martin
defied it: "I have with pain heard it said<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> that such
are the public prejudice against colonel Burr, that
a jury, even should they be satisfied of his innocence,
must have considerable firmness of mind to pronounce
him <i>not guilty</i>. I have not heard it without
horror.</p>

<p>"God of Heaven! have we already under our form
of government (which we have so often been told is
best calculated of all governments to secure all our
rights) arrived at a period when a trial in a court of
justice, where life is at stake, shall be but ... a mere
idle ... ceremony to transfer innocence from the
gaol to the gibbet, to gratify popular indignation
excited by bloodthirsty enemies!"</p>

<p>Martin closed by a personal appeal to Marshall:
"But if it require in such a situation firmness in a
jury, so does it equally require fortitude in judges to
perform their duty.... If they do not and the prisoner
fall a victim, they are guilty of murder in <i>foro
c&#339;li</i> whatever their guilt may be in <i>foro legis</i>....
May that God who now looks down upon us, and
who has in his infinite wisdom called you into existence
and placed you in that seat to dispense justice
to your fellow citizens, to preserve and protect innocence
against persecution&mdash;may that God so illuminate
your understandings that you may <i>know</i> what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
is right; and may he nerve your souls with firmness
and fortitude to <i>act</i> according to that knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p>The last word of this notable debate had been
spoken.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> The fate of Aaron Burr and of American
liberty, as affected by the law of treason, now rested
in the hands of John Marshall.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, August 31, the Chief Justice
read his opinion. All Richmond and the multitude
of strangers within her gates knew that the
proceedings, which for four months had enchained
the attention of all America, had now reached their
climax. Burr's friends were fearful, and hoped that
the laudanum calumny<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> would "strengthen" Marshall
to do his duty.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> For the moment the passions
of the throng were in abeyance while the breathless
spectators listened to Marshall's calm voice as it
pronounced the fateful words.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Chief Justice was one of the
longest ever rendered by him, and the only one in
which an extensive examination of authorities is
made. Indeed, a greater number of decisions, treatises,
and histories are referred to than in all the
rest of Marshall's foremost Constitutional opinions.
Like every one of these, the Burr opinion was a
state paper of first importance and marked a critical
phase in the development of the American Nation.</p>

<p>Marshall stated the points first to be decided:
under the Constitution can a man be convicted of
treason in levying war who was not present when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
the war was levied; and, if so, can testimony be received
"to charge one man with the overt acts of
others until those overt acts as laid in the indictment
be proved to the satisfaction of the court"? He
made clear the gravity of the Constitutional question:
"In every point of view in which it can be contemplated,
[it] is of infinite moment to the people of
this country and their government."<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>What was the meaning of the words, "'levying
war'?... Had their first application to treason been
made by our constitution they would certainly have
admitted of some latitude of construction." Even
so it was obvious that the term "levying war" literally
meant raising or creating and making war. "It
would be affirming boldly to say that those only who
actually constituted a portion of the military force appearing
in arms could be considered as levying war."</p>

<p>Suppose the case of "a commissary of purchases"
for an army raised to make war, who supplied it with
provisions; would he not "levy war" as much as any
other officer, although he may never have seen the
army? The same was true of "a recruiting officer
holding a commission in the rebel service, who,
though never in camp, executed the particular duty
assigned to him."</p>

<p>But levying war was not for the first time designated
as treason by the American Constitution.
"It is a technical term," borrowed from an ancient
English statute<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> and used in the Constitution in the
sense understood in that country and this at the
time our fundamental law was framed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only British decisions, but "those celebrated
elementary writers" whose "books are in the hands
of every student," and upon which "legal opinions
are formed" that are "carried to the bar, the bench
and the legislature"&mdash;all must be consulted in ascertaining
the import of such terms.<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a></p>

<p>Marshall reviewed Coke, Hale, Foster, and Blackstone,
and found them vague upon the question
"whether persons not in arms, but taking part in
a rebellion, could be said to levy war independent of
that legal rule [of constructive treason] which attaches
the guilt of the principal to an accessory."
Nor were the British decisions more satisfactory:
"If in adjudged cases this question [has] been ... directly
decided, the court has not seen those cases."<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a>
To trace the origin of "the doctrine that in treason all
are principals" was unimportant. However "spurious,"
it was the British principle settled for ages.</p>

<p>The American Constitution, however, "comprizes
no question respecting principal and accessory"&mdash;the
traitor must "truly and in fact levy war." He must
"perform a part in the prosecution of the war."<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a></p>

<p>Marshall then gingerly takes up the challenge of
his opinion in the case of Bollmann and Swartwout.
Since it had been upon the understanding by the
grand jury of his language in that opinion that Burr
had been indicted for treason, and because the Government
relied on it for conviction so far as the prosecution
depended on the law, the Chief Justice took
pains to make clear the disputed passages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some gentlemen have argued as if the supreme
court had adopted the whole doctrine of the English
books on the subject of accessories to treason.<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> But
certainly such is not the fact. Those only who perform
a part, and who are leagued in the conspiracy,
are declared to be traitors. To complete the definition
<i>both</i> circumstances must occur. They must 'perform
a part' which will furnish the overt act; and
they must be 'leagued in the conspiracy.'"</p>

<p>Did the things proved to have happened on Blennerhassett's
island amount to the overt act of levying
war? He had heard, said Marshall, that his opinion
in Bollmann and Swartwout was construed as
meaning that "any assemblage whatever for a treasonable
purpose, whether in force or not in force,
whether in a condition to use violence or not in that
condition, is a levying of war." That view of his
former opinion had not, indeed, "been expressly
advanced at the bar"; but Marshall understood, he
said, that "it was adopted elsewhere."<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a></p>

<p>Relying exclusively on reason, all would agree, he
continued, "that war could not be levied without
the employment and exhibition of force.... Intention
to go to war may be proved by words," but the
actual going to war must "be proved by open deed."<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>This natural and reasonable understanding of the
term was supported by the authorities. Marshall
then made specific reference to the opinions of a
large number of British writers and judges, and of
all American judges who had passed upon the question.
In none of these, he asserted, had "the words
'levying war' ... received a technical different from
their natural meaning"<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a>&mdash;that is, "the employment
and exhibition of force."</p>

<p>Had he overruled all these opinions in the Bollmann-Swartwout
case? Had he, in addition, reversed
the natural interpretation of the Constitution
which reason dictated? Surely not! Yet this was
what he was now charged with having done.</p>

<p>But, said Marshall, "an opinion which is to overrule
all former precedents, and to establish a principle
never before recognized, should be expressed
in plain and explicit terms." A mere implication
was not enough. Yet this was all there was to justify
the erroneous construction of his opinion in the case
of Bollmann and Swartwout&mdash;"the omission of
the court to state that the assemblage which constitutes
the fact of levying war ought to be in
force."<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a></p>

<p>Marshall then went into an extended and minute
analysis of his misunderstood opinion, and
painfully labored to show that he then intended to
say, as he now did say: that the act of levying war
required "an assemblage in force," and not merely
"a secret furtive assemblage without the appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
of force." The gathering "must be such as to prove
that [war] is its object." If it was not "a military
assemblage in a condition to make war, it was not a
levying of war."<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a></p>

<p>The indictment charged Burr with having levied
war at a specific place and stated the exact manner
in which the act had been done; this was necessary;
otherwise the accused could not make adequate defense.
So the indictment "must be proved as laid";
otherwise "the charge of an overt act would be a
mischief instead of an advantage to the accused,"
and would lead him from the true cause and nature
of the accusation instead of informing him
respecting it.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a></p>

<p>The Government insisted that, although Burr
"had never been with the party ... on Blennerhassett's
island, and was, at the time, at a great distance
and in a different state,... he was yet legally present,
and therefore may properly be charged in the indictment
as being present in fact." Thus, the question
arose "whether in this case the doctrine of constructive
presence can apply." In answering it, John
Marshall ended the contention that so cruel a dogma
can ever be applied in America. This achievement
was one of his noblest services to the American
people.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a></p>

<p>Again an imposing array of precedents was examined.
"The man, who incites, aids, or procures
a treasonable act," is not, merely on that account,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
"legally present when that act is committed."<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> Of
course, other facts might require that a man should
be considered to be present although really absent;
for example, if he were on the way there for the
purpose of taking part in the specific act charged,
or if he were stationed near in order to co&ouml;perate
with those who actually did the deed, he would be
of them and associated with them in the perpetration
of that particular act.<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> But otherwise he could
not be said to be present.</p>

<p>If this were not so, then a man levying war in one
part of the country might be construed to be present
at and taking part in hostilities at the most distant
point of the Republic&mdash;a participator in "every
overt act performed anywhere"; and he would be
liable to trial and conviction "in any state on the
continent where any overt act has been committed"
by anybody. "He may be proved to be guilty of an
overt act laid in the indictment in which he had no
personal participation, by proving that he advised
it, or that he committed other acts."<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a></p>

<p>If Burr were guilty of treason in connection with
the assemblage on Blennerhassett's island, it was
only because Burr procured the men to meet for the
purpose of levying war against the United States.
But the fact that he did procure the treasonable
assemblage must be charged in the indictment and
proved by two witnesses, precisely as must actual
physical presence&mdash;since the procuring of the assemblage
takes the place of presence at it. "If in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
one case," declared Marshall, "the presence of the
individual make the guilt of the assemblage his
guilt, and in the other case the procurement by the
individual make the guilt of the assemblage his
guilt, then presence and procurement are equally
component parts of the overt act, and equally require
two witnesses."<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<p>Neither presence nor procurement could, therefore,
be proved by collateral testimony: "No presumptive
evidence, no facts from which presence
may be conjectured or inferred will satisfy the constitution
and the law." And "if procurement take
the place of presence and become part of the overt
act, then no presumptive evidence, no facts from
which the procurement may be conjectured, or inferred,
can satisfy the constitution and the law.</p>

<p>"The mind is not to be led to the conclusion that
the individual was present by a train of conjectures,
of inferences, or of reasoning; the fact must be proved
by two witnesses," as required by the Constitution.
"Neither, where procurement supplies the want of
presence, is the mind to be conducted to the conclusion
that the accused procured the assembly, by a
train of conjectures or inferences or of reasoning; the
fact itself must be proved by two witnesses."<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a></p>

<p>To the objection that this could "scarcely ever"
be done, since "the advising or procurement of
treason is a secret transaction," the answer was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
said Marshall, "that the difficulty of proving a fact
will not justify conviction without proof." And
most "certainly it will not justify conviction without
[one] direct and positive witness in a case where the
constitution requires two." The true inference from
"this circumstance" was "that the advising of the
fact is not within the constitutional definition of the
crime. To advise or procure a treason ... is not
treason in itself."<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a></p>

<p>The testimony which the Government now proposed
to offer was to "prove&mdash;what? the overt act
laid in the indictment? that the prisoner was one
of those who assembled at Blennerhassett's island?
No!" But, instead, "evidence [of] subsequent transactions
at a different place and in a different state."
But such "testimony was not relevant." If it could
be introduced at all, it would be "only in the character
of corroborative or confirmatory testimony,
after the overt act has been proved by two witnesses
in such a manner that the question of fact ought to
be left with the jury."<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a></p>

<p>Before closing, Marshall answered the threats of
Hay and Wirt that, if he decided in favor of Burr,
he would be impeached: "That this court dares not
usurp power is most true. That this court dares not
shrink from its duty is not less true.... No man is
desirous of becoming the peculiar subject of calumny.
No man, might he let the bitter cup pass
from him without self reproach, would drain it to the
bottom. But if he have no choice in the case, if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
be no alternative presented to him but a dereliction
of duty or the opprobrium of those who are denominated
the world, he merits the contempt as well
as the indignation of his country who can hesitate
which to embrace."<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a></p>

<p>Let the jury apply the law as announced to the
facts as proved and "find a verdict of guilty or not
guilty as their own consciences shall direct."</p>

<p>The next morning the petit jury retired, but
quickly returned. Marshall's brother-in-law, Colonel
Edward Carrington, foreman, rose and informed
the court that the jury had agreed upon a verdict.</p>

<p>"Let it be read," gravely ordered Marshall.</p>

<p>And Colonel Carrington read the words of that
peculiar verdict:</p>

<p>"We of the jury say that Aaron Burr is not
proved to be guilty under this indictment by any
evidence submitted to us. We therefore find him
not guilty."<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a></p>

<p>Instantly Burr, Martin, Wickham, and Botts were
on their feet protesting. This was no verdict, according
to law. It was informal, irregular. In such
cases, said Burr, the jury always was sent back to
alter it or else the court itself corrected it; and he
accurately stated the proper procedure.</p>

<p>Discussion followed. Hay insisted that the verdict
be received and recorded as returned. "It was
like the whole play," exclaimed Martin, "Much
Ado About Nothing." Of course the verdict must
be corrected. Did the jury mean to "censure ... the
court for suppressing irrelevant testimony?" Un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>thinkable!
And if not, they ought to answer simply
"Guilty" or "Not Guilty."<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Carrington informed the court that,
among themselves, the jury had said that "they
would alter the verdict if it was informal&mdash;it was
in fact a verdict of acquittal." Richard E. Parker,
also of the jury, said he never would agree to change
the form&mdash;they knew what they were about when
they adopted it. Parker was "a violent Jeffersonian
partisan," and Burr's friends had reproved him for
accepting such a man as a member of the jury.<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a></p>

<p>Soothingly Marshall directed that the verdict
"stand on the bill" as the jury wished it; but, since
it was "in effect a verdict of acquittal," let "an
entry be made on the record of 'Not Guilty.'"</p>

<p>The Chief Justice "politely thanked the jury for
their patient attention during the whole course of
this long trial, and then discharged them."<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a></p>

<p>A week before Marshall delivered his opinion, an
attempt was made to induce Blennerhassett to betray
Burr. On August 23 William Duane, editor of
the <i>Aurora</i>, and an intimate friend, supporter, and
agent of Jefferson, approached Blennerhassett for
that purpose, and offered to go to Washington, "now
or at any time hereafter," in his behalf. Duane assured
him that the Administration would refuse him
(Duane) "nothing he should ask." But Blennerhassett
repulsed Duane's advances.<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p>

<p>Hay, angry and discomfited, entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i>
to the indictments of Dayton, Blennerhassett,
and the others for the same crime; but, in obedience
to Jefferson's orders, demanded that all of them,
Burr included, be still held under the charge of treason,
that they might be sent for trial to some place
where an overt act might have been committed.<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>
Marshall, after enduring another long argument,
gently put the application aside because all the conspirators
were now to be tried upon the charge of
misdemeanor under the second indictment.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a></p>

<p>Marshall's motives were clearer than ever to Jefferson.
"The event has been what was evidently intended
from the beginning of the trial; ... not only
to clear Burr, but to prevent the evidence from ever
going before the world. But this latter case must
not take place." Hay must see to it that "not a
single witness be paid or permitted to depart until
his testimony has been committed to writing....
These whole proceedings will be laid before Congress,
that they may ... provide the proper remedy."<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson ordered Hay to press for trial on the indictment
for misdemeanor, not with the expectation
of convicting Burr, but in the hope that some sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
testimony would be brought out that would convict
Marshall in the court of public opinion, and perhaps
serve as a pretext for impeaching him. Thus, in the
second trial of which we are now to be spectators,
"the chief-justice was occupied in hearing testimony
intended for use not against Burr, but against himself."<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>
It was for this reason that Marshall, when
the trial for misdemeanor began, threw open wide
the doors to testimony.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a></p>

<p>Burr's counsel, made unwise by victory, insisted
that he should not be required to give bail, and Marshall,
although the point had been decided and was
not open to dispute, permitted and actually encouraged
exasperatingly extended argument upon it.<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>
Burr had submitted to give bail at the beginning,
said Botts, not because it was "demandable of
right," but because he and his counsel "had reason
to apprehend danger ... from the violence and turbulence
of the mob."<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a></p>

<p>Marshall was careful to deliver another long and,
except for the political effect, wholly unnecessary
opinion; nor was it directly on the matter at issue.
Counsel floundered through a tangle of questions,
Marshall exhibiting apparent indecision by manifesting
great concern, even on the simplest points.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="600" height="784" alt="John Marshall by Robert Matthew Sully" title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>John Marshall<br />

Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.</small></i></span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, he ordered that Burr "be acquitted and discharged"
as to the indictment for treason, but to be
held in five thousand dollars bail under the indictment
for misdemeanor. Jonathan Dayton and William
Langbourne offered themselves and were accepted
as sureties; and on September 3, after nearly
nine weeks of imprisonment, Burr walked out of
court unhindered, no longer to be under lock and
bar and armed guard.<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a></p>

<p>Merry were the scenes in the houses of Richmond
society that night; hilarious the rejoicing about the
flowing board of Luther Martin; and, confused and
afflicted with a blurred anger, the patriotic multitude
talked resentfully of Marshall's decision. On
one side it was said that justice had prevailed and
persecution had been defeated; on the other, that
justice had been mocked and treason protected. Hay,
Wirt, and MacRae were bitter and despondent;
Edmund Randolph, Botts, Martin, and Burr, jubilant
and aggressive.</p>

<p>Many conflicting stories sprang up concerning
Marshall&mdash;his majestic bearing on the bench, his
servility, his courage, his timidity. One of these has
survived: "Why did you not tell Judge Marshall
that the people of America demanded a conviction?"
a disgusted Republican asked of Wirt. "Tell <i>him</i>
that!" exclaimed Wirt. "I would as soon have gone
to Herschel, and told him that the people of America
insisted that the moon had horns as a reason why he
should draw her with them."<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain of the "conspiracy" had never lost
heart, and, save when angered by Marshall's seeming
inconsistency and indecision, had continued to be
cheery and buoyant. Steadily he had assured his
friends that, when acquitted, he would again take
up and put through his plans. This thought now
dominated him. Blennerhassett, upon visiting his
chief, found Burr "as gay as usual, and as busy in
speculations on reorganizing his projects for action
as if he had never suffered the least interruption,"
with better prospects for success than ever.<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a></p>

<p>Quick to press his advantage, Burr the next morning
demanded the production of the letters called
for in the subp&#339;na <i>duces tecum</i> to Jefferson. These
had not been forthcoming, and Burr asserted the
President to be in contempt of court and subject to
punishment therefor.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> Once more altercation flared
up in debate. Hay said he had one of the letters;
that it had not "the most distant bearing on the
subject," and that he might prefer "to be put in
prison" rather than disclose its contents.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson had become very nervous about Marshall's
order and plainly feared that the Chief Justice
might attempt to enforce it. The thought frightened
him; he had no stomach for a direct encounter.
At last he wished to compose the differences between
himself and the obstinate and fearless, if gentle-mannered,
Marshall. So the President directed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
district attorney to tell the United States Marshal
to obey no order of the court and to intimate to
the Chief Justice the wisdom of deferring the vexed
question until the next session of Congress.</p>

<p>He wrote, said Jefferson, "in a spirit of conciliation
and with the desire to avoid conflicts of authority
between the high branches of the government
which would discredit equally at home and abroad."
Naturally Burr and his counsel would like "to convert
this trial into a contest between the judiciary &amp;
Exve Authorities"; but he had not "expected ...
that the Ch. Justice would lend himself to it."
Surely Marshall's "prudence and good sense" would
not "permit him to press it."</p>

<p>But if Marshall was determined to attack Jefferson
and "issue any process which [would] involve
any act of force to be committed on the persons of
the Exve or heads of departs," Hay was to give
Jefferson "instant notice, and by express if you find
that can be done quicker than by post; and ... moreover
... advise the marshal on his conduct as he will
be critically placed between us."</p>

<p>The "safest way" for that officer to pursue "will
be to take no part in the exercise of any act of force
ordered in this case. The powers given the Exve by
the constn are sufficient to protect the other branches
from judiciary usurpation of pre-eminence, &amp; every
individual also from judiciary vengeance, and the
marshal may be assured of it's effective exercise to
cover him."</p>

<p>Such was Jefferson's threat to use force against
the execution of the process of the National courts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
But the President went on: "I hope however that
the discretion of the C. J. will suffer this question to
lie over for the present, and at the ensuing session
of the legislature [Congress] he may have means
provided for giving individuals the benefit of the
testimony of the Exve functionaries in proper cases,
without breaking up the government. <i>Will not the
associate judge</i> [Cyrus Griffin] <i>assume to divide his
court and procure a truce at least in so critical a
conjuncture?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a></p>

<p>When Hay acknowledged that he had one of the
letters from Wilkinson to Jefferson, a subp&#339;na <i>duces
tecum</i> was served on the District Attorney, notwithstanding
his gallant declaration that he would
not produce it even if he were sent to jail for not
doing so. Hay then returned a copy of such parts of
the letter as he thought "material for the purposes
of justice," declining to give those passages which
Jefferson deemed "confidential."<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> Burr insisted on
the production of the entire letter.</p>

<p>Botts moved that the trial be postponed "till the
letter shall be produced." Another of that unending
series of arguments followed,<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a> and still another of
Marshall's cautious but convincing opinions came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
forth. Jefferson, he said, had not forbidden the production
of the letter&mdash;the President, in response to
the subp&#339;na upon him, had sent the document to
Hay, leaving to the discretion of the District Attorney
the question as to what should be done with it. Of
course if, for public reasons, Jefferson had declined
to produce the letter, his "motives may [have been]
such as to restrain the court" from compelling him
to do so.<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> At least Burr might see the letter now;
consideration of the other features of the controversy
would be deferred.<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a></p>

<p>The distracted Hay, his sour temper made more
acid by a "greatly aggravated influenza," wrote
Jefferson of the Government's predicament; Marshall's
remarks from the bench had not been explicit,
he said, and "it is impossible to foresee what his
opinion will be unless I could foresee what will be
the state of his nerves. Wirt, who has hitherto advocated
the <i>integrity</i> of the Chief Justice, now
abandons him."</p>

<p>The District Attorney dolefully tells the President
that he is "very decidedly of the opinion, that these
prosecutions will terminate in nothing." He thinks
the Government will be defeated on the trials for
misdemeanor, and believes the indictments for that
offense should be dismissed and motion made for
the commitment of Burr, Blennerhassett, and Smith
to be transferred to some spot where their crime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
might be proved. "Instruct me," he begs Jefferson,
"specially on this point."<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson, now on his vacation at Monticello,
directed Hay to press at Richmond the trial of
Burr for misdemeanor. "If defeated it will heap
coals of fire on the head of the judge; if convicted,
it will give them time to see whether a prosecution
for treason can be instituted against him in
any, and what court." A second subp&#339;na <i>duces
tecum</i> seems to have been issued against Jefferson,<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>
and he defiantly refused to "sanction a proceeding
so preposterous," by "any notice" of it.<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> And there
this heated and dangerous controversy appears to
have ended.<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the hearing of evidence began on the indictment
against Burr for misdemeanor&mdash;for having
conducted an attack upon Mexico. For seven weeks
the struggle went on. The Government's attorneys
showed the effects of the long and losing fight. Many
witnesses were sent home unexamined or merely leaving
their affidavits. Hay acted like the sick man he
really was. The dour MacRae appeared "utterly
chop-fallen; an object of disgust to his friends, and
pity to his enemies."<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> Only Wirt, with his fine gallantry
of spirit, bore himself manfully. Motions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
arguments, opinions continued. One of Marshall's
rulings on the admissibility of evidence moved Blennerhassett
to ecstasies.<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a></p>

<p>More than fifty witnesses were examined, the
heavy preponderance of the evidence clearly showing
that Burr's purpose and expectations had been
to settle the Washita lands and, in case the United
States went to war with Spain, and <i>only in that
event</i>, to lead a force against the Spaniards. No
testimony whatever was given tending to disclose
any hostile plans against the United States, or even
for an attack upon Mexico without war between
America and Spain, except that of Wilkinson, Eaton,
Taylor, Allbright, and the Morgans, as already set
out. One witness also told of a wild and fanciful talk
by the eccentric and imaginative Blennerhassett.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>The credibility of Dunbaugh was destroyed. Wilkinson
was exposed in a despicable light,<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> and Eaton
appeared more fantastic than ever; but both these
heroes put on looks of lofty defiance. The warrior-diplomat
of Algerian fame had now fallen so low in
the public esteem that one disgusted Virginian had
threatened to kick him out of a room.<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a></p>

<p>On September 15, 1807, the District Attorney, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
attempting to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> on the indictment
of Burr for misdemeanor, tried to prevent
the jury from rendering a verdict.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> One member
of the jury wanted that body to return a special
finding; but his associates would have none of it,
and in half an hour they reported a straight verdict
of "Not Guilty."<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a></p>

<p>Hay dismissed further proceedings against Smith
and Blennerhassett on the indictments for misdemeanor,
and then moved to commit Burr and his
associates upon the charge of treason by "levying
war" within the jurisdiction of the United States
Court for the District of Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> On this motion,
Marshall, as an examining magistrate, gave the
Government wide scope in the introduction of testimony,
to the immense disgust of the triply accused
men. Blennerhassett thought that Marshall was
conciliating "public prejudice."<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> Burr told his
counsel that the Chief Justice "did not for two days
together understand either the questions or himself
... and should in future be put right by strong language."
So angered was he with Marshall's "wavering,"
that at times "Burr ... would not trust
himself to rise up to sum up and condense the forces
displayed by his counsel, into compact columns,
after the engagement, toward the close of the day,
as is generally his practice."<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a></p>

<p>Just at this time appeared a pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> by Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>shall's
brother-in-law, Joseph Hamilton Daveiss.
Jefferson had removed him from the office of United
States Attorney for the District of Kentucky because
of Daveiss's failure in his attacks on Burr,
and the revengeful Federalist lawyer and politician
retaliated by abusing the President, Wilkinson, and
Burr equally. Between Daveiss's pamphlet and
Marshall's sudden admission of evidence, some saw
a direct connection; the previous knowledge Marshall
must have had of his brother-in-law's intended
assault, inferred because of "the well-known spirit of
clanship and co-operation with which the Marshalls
and all their connections are so uniformly animated,"
showed, it was alleged, that the Chief Justice was
working with his kinsman to bring down in indiscriminate
ruin, Jefferson, Burr, and Wilkinson together.</p>

<p>The last volume of Marshall's "Life of Washington,"
that "five volumed libel," as Jefferson
branded the biography, had recently appeared.
Blennerhassett, who, in expressing his own opinions,
usually reflected those of his associates, had "no
doubt" that the President's perusal of Marshall's
last volume and Daveiss's pamphlet "inspired Jefferson
with a more deadly hatred of the Marshall
faction than he has ever conceived of all the Burrites
he ever heard of."<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a></p>

<p>The President's partisans in Virginia were prompt
to stoke the furnace of his wrath. William Thompson
of Petersburgh<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> wrote a brief "view" of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
Burr trial and sent "the first 72. pages" to Jefferson,
who read them "with great satisfaction" and clamored
for more.<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> Marshall's conduct should indeed
fill everybody "with alarm," wrote Jefferson in
reply. "We had supposed we possessed fixed laws
to guard us equally against treason &amp; oppression.
But it now appears we have no law but the will of the
judge. Never will chicanery have a more difficult
task than has been now accomplished to warp the
text of the law to the will of him who is to construe
it. Our case too is the more desperate as to attempt
to make the law plainer by amendment is only
throwing out new materials for sophistry."<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a></p>

<p>The Federalists in Washington, fast dwindling in
power and number, experienced as much relief as
their chronic melancholia permitted them to enjoy.
"Had the late vice president and two senators been
convicted and executed for treason, it would in the
opinion of Europe, have reflected disgrace upon our
country," notes Senator Plumer in his diary.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a></p>

<p>Hay, on the other hand, thought that "a correct
and perspicuous legal history of this trial would be a
valuable document in the hands of intelligent legislators,"
but that "among others it might perhaps do
mischief. It might produce a sentiment toward all
judicial system and law itself, the operation of
which might perhaps be fatal to the tranquillity and
good order of Society."<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span></p>

<p>On October 20, Marshall delivered his last opinion
in the Burr trials. It was upon the Government's
motion to commit Burr and his associates for treason
and misdemeanor committed on the dismal island
at the mouth of the Cumberland, where Burr had
first greeted his little band of settlers and potential
adventurers. He must grant the motion, Marshall
said, "unless it was perfectly clear that the act was
innocent." If there was any doubt, the accused must
be held. The Chief Justice then carefully analyzed
all the evidence.<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> He concluded that Burr's purposes
were to settle the Washita lands and to invade
Mexico if opportunity offered, perhaps, however,
only in the event of war with Spain. But
whether this was so ought to be left to the jury;
Marshall would "make no comment upon it which
might, the one way or the other, influence their judgment."<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>
He therefore would commit Burr and Blennerhassett
"for preparing and providing the means
for a military expedition" against Spain.</p>

<p>"After all, this is a sort of drawn battle," Burr
informed Theodosia. "This opinion was a matter of
regret and surprise to the friends of the chief justice
and of ridicule to his enemies&mdash;all believing that it
was a sacrifice of principle to conciliate <i>Jack Cade</i>.
Mr. Hay immediately said that he should advise the
government to <i>desist from further prosecution</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span></p>

<p>If Marshall disappointed Burr, he infuriated Jefferson.
In the closing words of his opinion the Chief
Justice flung at the President this challenge: "If
those whose province and duty it is to prosecute offenders
against the laws of the United States shall be
of the opinion that a crime of a deeper dye has been
committed, it is at their choice to act in conformity
with that opinion"&mdash;in short, let Jefferson now do
his worst.</p>

<p>Marshall's final opinion and his commitment of
Burr, under bail, to be tried in Ohio for possible misdemeanor
at the mouth of the Cumberland should
a grand jury indict him for that offense, disgusted
Burr. Indeed he was so "exasperated" that "he
was rude and insulting to the Judge."<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> Nor did
Marshall's friends in Richmond feel differently.
They "are as much dissatisfied," records Blennerhassett,
"with his opinion yesterday as Government
has been with all his former decisions. He is a good
man, and an able lawyer, but timid and yielding
under the fear of the multitude, led ... by the vindictive
spirit of the party in power."<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a></p>

<p>Burr gave the bond of five thousand dollars required
by Marshall, but in Ohio the Government
declined to pursue the prosecution.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> Burr put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
whole matter out of his mind as a closed incident,
left Richmond, and started anew upon the execution
of his one great plan as though the interruption of
it had never happened.</p>

<p>Marshall hurried away to the Blue Ridge. "The
day after the commitment of Col<sup>o</sup>. Burr for a misdemeanor
I galloped to the mountains," he tells
Judge Peters. During the trial Peters had sent Marshall
a volume of his admiralty decisions; and when
he returned from his belated vacation, the Chief
Justice acknowledged the courtesy: "I have as yet
been able only to peep into the book.... I received it
while fatigued and occupied with the most unpleasant
case which has ever been brought before a Judge
in this or perhaps any other country, which affected
to be governed by laws, since the decision of which
I have been entirely from home.... I only returned in
time to perform my North Carolina Circuit which
terminates just soon enough to enable me to be here
to open the Court for the antient dominion. Thus
you perceive I have sufficient bodily employment
to prevent my mind from perplexing itself about the
attentions paid me in Baltimore and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a></p>

<p>"I wish I could have had as fair an opportunity to
let the business go off as a jest here as you seem to
have had in Pennsylvania: but it was most deplorably
serious &amp; I could not give the subject a different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
aspect by treating it in any manner which was in my
power. I might perhaps have made it less serious to
my self by obeying the public will instead of the
public law &amp; throwing a little more of the sombre
upon others."<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a></p>

<p>While Marshall was resting in the mountains,
Jefferson was writing his reply to the last challenge
of the Chief Justice.<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> In his Message to Congress
which he prepared immediately after the Burr trials,
he urged the House to impeach Marshall. He felt
it to be his duty, he said, to transmit a record of
the Burr trial. "<i>Truth &amp; duty alone extort the observation
that wherever the laws were appealed to in aid of
the public safety, their operation was on behalf of those
only against whom they were invoked.</i>" From the record
"you will be enabled to judge whether the defect
was in the testimony, or in the laws, or <i>whether
there is not a radical defect</i> in the administration of
the law? And wherever it shall be found the legislature
alone can apply or originate the remedy.</p>

<p>"The framers of our constitution certainly supposed
they had guarded, as well their government
against destruction by treason, as their citizens
against oppression under pretence of it: and if <i>the
pliability of the law as construed in the case of Fries,<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>
and it's wonderful refractoriness as construed in that
of Burr, shew that neither end has been attained, and
induce an awful doubt whether we all live under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
same law. The right of the jury too to decide law as well
as fact seems nugatory without the evidence pertinent to
their sense of the law.</i> If these ends are not attained
it becomes worthy of enquiry by what means more
effectual they may be secured?"<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a></p>

<p>On the advice of his Cabinet,<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> Jefferson struck
out from the Message the sentences italicized above.
But even with this strong language omitted, Congress
was told to impeach Marshall in far more
emphatic terms than those by which Jefferson had
directed the impeachment of Pickering&mdash;in plainer
words, indeed, than those privately written to
Nicholson ordering the attack upon Chase. Jefferson's
assault on Marshall was also inserted in a Message
dealing with probable war against Great Britain
and setting out the continuance of our unhappy
relations with Spain, "to our former grounds of
complaint" against which country had "been added
a very serious one."<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a></p>

<p>Had these grave conditions not engaged the instant
attention of Congress, had public sentiment&mdash;even
with part of its fury drawn from Burr to Great
Britain&mdash;been heeded at the National Capital,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
there can be little doubt that John Marshall would
have been impeached by the House that was now
all but unanimously Republican, and would have
been convicted by the overwhelmingly Jeffersonian
Senate.</p>

<p>Well for Marshall's peace of mind that he had
secluded himself in the solitudes of the Blue Ridge,
for never was an American judge subjected to abuse
so unsparing. The Jeffersonian press, particularly
the <i>Aurora</i> and the <i>Enquirer</i>, the two leading Republican
papers, went to the limits of invective.
"Let the judge be impeached," said the <i>Enquirer</i>;
the Wickham dinner was recalled&mdash;why had Marshall
attended it? His speech on the Jonathan
Robins case<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a>&mdash;"the price of his seat on the bench"&mdash;was
"a lasting monument of his capacity to defend
error."</p>

<p>Marshall's "wavering and irresolute spirit"
manifested throughout the trial had disgusted
everybody. His attempt to make his rulings
"palatable to all parties" had "so often wrapt them
in obscurity" that it was hard "to understand on
which side the court had decided." His conduct had
been inspired by "power illicitly obtained." And
think of his encouragement to Burr's counsel to
indulge in "unbounded ... slander and vilification"
of the President! Callender's libel on Adams was
insipid compared with Martin's vulgar billingsgate
toward Jefferson! But that "awful tribunal"&mdash;the
people&mdash;would try Marshall; before it "evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
will neither be perverted nor suppressed.... The
character of the Chief Justice awaits the issue."<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a></p>

<p>Another attack soon followed. Marshall's disgraceful
conduct "has proved that the Judges are
too independent of the people." Let them be made
removable by the President on the address of Congress.
The Chase trial had shown that impeachment
could not be relied on to cleanse the bench of a judge
no matter how "noxious," "ridiculous," "contemptible,"
or "immoral" he might be. But "shall an
imposter be suffered to preside on the bench of justice?...
Are we to be eternally pestered with that
most ridiculous and dangerous cant; that the people
... are incompetent to their own government: and
that masters must be set over them and that barriers
are to be raised up to protect those masters
from the vengeance of the people?"<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a></p>

<p>Next came a series of "Letters to John Marshall,"
which appeared simultaneously in the <i>Aurora</i>
and the <i>Enquirer</i>. They were written by William
Thompson under the <i>nom de guerre</i> of "Lucius";
he undoubtedly was also the author of the earlier
attacks on the Chief Justice in the <i>Enquirer</i>. They
were widely copied in the Republican press of the
country, and were a veracious expression of public
sentiment.</p>

<p>"Your country, sir, owes you a debt of gratitude
for former favors," which cannot be paid because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
"the whole stock of national indignation and contempt
would be exhausted, before the half of your
just claim could be discharged." Marshall had
earned "infamy and detestation" by his efforts to
erect "tyranny upon the tomb of freedom." His
skill "in conducting the manouvres of a political
party," his "crafty cunning" as a diplomat, had been
perpetuated by the "genius" of John Thompson,
whose "literary glory ... will shine when even the
splendour of your talents and your crimes shall have
faded forever. When your volumes of apology for
British insolence and cruelty<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> shall be buried in
oblivion, the 'Letters of Curtius'<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> will ... 'damn you
to everlasting fame.'" Marshall's entire life, according
to Lucius, had been that of a sly, bigoted politician
who had always worked against the people.
He might have become "one of the boasted patriots
of Virginia," but now he was "a disgrace to the
bench of justice." He was a Jeffreys, a Bromley, a
Mansfield.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<p>Quickly appeared a second letter to Marshall,
accusing him of having "prostrated the dignity of
the chief justice of the United States." Lucius goes
into a lengthy analysis of Marshall's numerous opinions
in the Burr trials. A just review of the proceedings,
he said, demonstrates that the Chief Justice
had "exhibited a culpable partiality towards the
accused, and a shameless solicitude ... to implicate
the government ... as negligent of their duty"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>&mdash;something
that "a less malicious magistrate" never
would have dared to display.<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> A third letter continued
the castigation of Marshall and the defense
of Jefferson. Closing an extended argument on
this joint theme, Lucius addressed Marshall thus:
"Common sense, and violated justice, cry aloud
against such conduct; and demand against you the
enforcement of these laws, which you refuse to administer."<a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a></p>

<p>All these arraignments of Marshall had, as we
have seen,<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> been submitted to Jefferson. They rose
in the final letter to a climax of vituperation: "Could
I be instrumental in removing you from the elevation
which you have dishonored by ... your crimes, I
would still trace you ... for screening a criminal and
degrading a judge" by the "juggle of a judicial
farce." Marshall and Burr were alike "morally
guilty," alike "traitors in heart and in fact.... Such
a criminal and such a judge, few countries ever produced....
You are forever doomed to blot the fair
page of American history, to be held up, as examples
of infamy and disgrace, of perverted talents and unpunished
criminality, of foes to liberty and traitors
to your country."<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a></p>

<p>Incited by similar attacks in the Republican press
of Baltimore,<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> the more ardent patriots of that
place resolved publicly to execute Marshall in effigy,
along with Burr, Blennerhassett, and Martin,
On the morning of November 3, satirical handbills,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
announcing this act of public justice, were scattered
over the city:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"AWFUL!!!</p>

<p>"The public are hereby notified that four 'choice
spirits' are this afternoon, at 3 o'clock, to be marshaled
for execution by the hangman, on Gallows
Hill, in consequence of the sentence pronounced
against them by the unanimous voice of every honest
man in the community.</p>

<p>"The respective crimes for which they suffer are
thus stated in the record:</p>

<p>"First, Chief Justice M. for a repetition of his
X.Y.Z. tricks, which are said to be much aggravated
by his <i>felonins</i> [<i>sic</i>] capers in open Court, on the plea
of irrelevancy;</p>

<p>"Secondly, His Quid Majesty [Burr], charged with
the trifling fault of wishing to divide the Union, and
farm <i>Baron</i> Bastrop's grant;</p>

<p>"Thirdly, B[lennerhassett], the chemist, convicted
of conspiracy to destroy the tone of the public Fiddle;</p>

<p>"Fourthly, and lastly, but not least, <i>Lawyer</i>
Brandy-Bottle, for a false, scandalous, malicious
Prophecy, that, before six months, 'Aaron Burr
would divide the Union.'</p>

<p>"N.B. The execution of accomplices is postponed
to a future day."<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a></p></div>

<p>Martin demanded of the Mayor the protection of
the law. In response, police were sent to his house
and to the Evans Hotel where Blennerhassett was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
staying. Burr and the faithful Swartwout, who had
accompanied his friend and leader, were escorted
by a guard to the stage office, where they quickly
left for Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> Martin's law students and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
other friends armed themselves to resist violence
to him.</p>

<p>A policeman named Goldsmith notified Blenner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>hassett
that a great mob was gathering, "had everything
prepared for tarring and feathering and would,
... if disappointed or opposed, tear Martin [and
Blennerhassett] to pieces." The manager of the
hotel begged Blennerhassett to hide in the garret
of the hostelry. This the forlorn Irishman did,
and beheld from a window in the attic what passed
below.</p>

<p>Shouting and huzzaing men poured by, headed
by fifers and drummers playing the "Rogue's
march." Midway in the riotous throng were drawn
two carts containing effigies of Chief Justice Marshall
and the other popularly condemned men "habited
for execution.... Two troops of cavalry patrolled
the streets, not to disperse the mob, but to follow
and behold their conduct." At Martin's house the
crowd stopped for a moment, hurling threats and
insults, jeering at and defying the armed defenders
within and "the cavalry without."</p>

<p>Making "as much noise as if they were about to
destroy the city," these devotees of justice and liberty
proceeded to the place of public execution.
There, amid roars of approval, the effigy of John
Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States, was
hanged by the neck until the executioner pronounced
the stuffed figure to be dead. About him dangled
from the gibbet the forms of the "traitors"&mdash;Aaron
Burr and Harman Blennerhassett&mdash;and also that
of Luther Martin, who had dared to defend them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
and had thus incurred the malediction of Thomas
Jefferson and "the people."<a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a></p>

<p>In the Senate Giles reported a bill to punish as
traitors persons who permitted or aided in the perpetration
of certain acts, "although not personally
present when any such act was done"; and he supported
it in an argument of notable ability. He
powerfully attacked Marshall, analyzed his opinions
in the Burr case, contrasted them with those of other
National judges, and pointed out the resulting confusion
in the interpretation of the law. All this was
spoken, however, with careful regard to the rules of
parliamentary discussion.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a></p>

<p>Legislation was necessary, said Giles; as matters
stood, the decisions of judges on treason were like
Congress "enacting our speeches, interspersed with
our laws." With what result? No two judges have
yet delivered the same opinion upon some of the
most essential features of treason. Take for example
the British doctrine that, in treason, accessories are
principals. Were they in America? "Judge Chase
and others say they are. Judge Marshall says he
does not know whether they are or not, but his
reasoning would go to show that they are not."<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a></p>

<p>Solely to gratify <i>vox populi</i>, the Senate next indulged
in a doubtful performance. An attempt was
made to expel Senator John Smith of Ohio. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
only a partial examination, and without allowing
him to call a single witness in his own behalf beforehand,
a special Senate Committee<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a> presented a report
concluding with a resolution to expel Smith
because of "his participation in the conspiracy of
Aaron Burr against the peace, union and liberties
of the people of the United States."<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> This surprising
document was the work of John Quincy Adams,<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>
who apparently adopted the ideas and almost the
language of Lucius.</p>

<p>Burr's conspiracy, wrote Adams, was so evil and
was "established by such a mass of concurring and
mutually corroborative testimony" that the "honor"
of the Senate and "the deepest interests of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
nation" required that nobody connected with it
should be a member of Congress. After an unctuous
recitation of accepted generalities and a review of
the expulsion of Senator Blount, together with an
excellent statement of the law of parliamentary
bodies in such cases, Adams got down to the business
of destroying John Marshall.<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a></p>

<p>Marshall had "withheld from the jury ... a great
part of the testimony which was essential to [Burr's]
conviction.... In consequence of this suppression of
evidence" the trial jury had not been allowed to find
a verdict of guilty against the traitor. Marshall's
"decisions, forming the basis of the issue upon the
trials of Burr ... were the sole inducements upon
which the counsel for the United States abandoned
the prosecution against him" (Smith). An American
grand jury had charged Senator Smith with being
"an accomplice" of these diabolical plans, and the
safety which Marshall's decisions in the Burr trial
had thrown around Smith and other associates of
the traitor "cannot, in the slightest degree, remove
the imputation" which the indictment of Smith had
brought to his door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>

<p>"If," wrote Adams, "the daylight of evidence
combining one vast complicated intention, with
overt acts innumerable, be not excluded from the
mind by the curtain of artificial rules, the simplest
understanding cannot but see what the subtlest
understanding cannot disguise, crimes before which
ordinary treason whitens into virtue" and beyond
"the ingenuity of a demon."</p>

<p>Adams continued: "Whether the transactions
proved against Aaron Burr did or did not amount,
in technical language, to an overt act of levying
war, your committee have not a scruple of doubt
... that, but for the vigilance and energy of the
government, and of faithful citizens under its directions
... in crushing his designs, they would ...
have terminated not only in war, but in a war of
the most horrible description, ... at once foreign
and domestic."</p>

<p>To such lengths can popular demand, however
unjust, drive even cold, unemotional, and upright
men who are politically ambitious. Adams's Federalist
confr&egrave;res reacted quickly;<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> and the <i>New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
York Evening Post</i> sharply criticized him.<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a> When
the report came up in the Senate, James A. Bayard
of Delaware, and James Hillhouse of Connecticut,
attacked it and its author with "unusual virulence."
Bayard was especially severe.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> Thus assailed, Adams
was cast into black depression: "It is indeed a fiery
ordeal I have to go through. God speed me through
it!" he wrote in his diary that night.<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a></p>

<p>William Branch Giles cast the deciding vote which
defeated Adams's resolution&mdash;the Senate refusing
to expel Smith by a vote of 19 yeas to 10 nays,<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> just
one short of the necessary two thirds. The Virginia
Republican Senator attacked the resolution with
all his fiery eloquence, and compelled the admiration
even of Adams himself.<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> "I shall vote against the
resolution," Giles concluded, "solely from the conviction
of the innocence of the accused."<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a></p>

<p>Herefrom one may judge the temper of the times
and the perilous waters through which John Marshall
had been compelled to pilot the craft of justice. If
that "most deliberative legislative body" in our
Government, and the one least affected by popular
storms, was so worked upon, one can perceive the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
conditions that surrounded the Chief Justice in
overcrowded Richmond during the trial of Aaron
Burr, and the real impending danger for Marshall,
after the acquittal of the man whom Jefferson and the
majority had branded with the most hideous infamy.</p>

<p>Fortunate, indeed, for the Chief Justice of the
United States, and for the stability of American
institutions, that the machinery of impeachment
was, during these fateful months, locked because
the President, Congress, and the Nation were forced
to give their attention to the grave foreign situation
which could no longer be ignored.</p>

<p>Going about his duties in Washington, or, at
home, plodding out to the farm near Richmond,
joking or gossiping with friends, and caring for his
afflicted wife, Marshall heard the thunders of popular
denunciation gradually swallowed up in the
louder and ever-increasing reverberations that heralded
approaching war with Great Britain. Before
the clash of arms arrived, however, his level common
sense and intelligent courage were again called upon
to deal with another of those perplexing conditions
which produced, one by one, opinions from the Supreme
Bench that have become a part of the living,
growing, yet stable and enduring Constitution of
the American Nation.</p>

by inference, to his friends in France his want of energy in the Chesapeake
affair and the vigor he displayed in the prosecution of Burr.
"Burr's conspiracy has been one of the most flagitious of which
history will ever furnish an example.... Yet altho' there is not a man in
the U S who is not satisfied of the depth of his guilt, such are the jealous
provisions of our laws in favor of the accused, ... that I question
if he can be convicted." (Jefferson to Du Pont de Nemours, July 14,
1807, <i>Works</i>: Ford, <span class="smcap">x</span>, 461; also see same to Lafayette, same date, <i>ib.</i>
463.) It will be observed that in these letters Jefferson condemns the
laxity of American laws instead of blaming Marshall.</p></div>

given for immuring him in this abode of thieves, cut-throats, and

which may never have been sent, but which is of the utmost importance."
(<i>Works</i>: Ford, <span class="smcap">x</span>, 406-07.) It would seem that Jefferson wrote
either to Marshall or Judge Griffin personally, for the first words of his
astounding letter to Hay were: "The <i>enclosed letter</i> is written in a

posted the letter to Hay, the draft quoted in the text shows the impression

had Marshall been impeached. It would be "penance for that timidity
of conduct, which was probably as instrumental in keeping him from
imbruing his hands in our blood as it was operative in inducing him
to continue my vexations [the commitment of the conspirators to be

hoping to get from the British Government support for his plans
to revolutionize Mexico. At first all went well. Men like Jeremy
Bentham and Sir Walter Scott became his friends and admirers. But
the hand of Jefferson followed him; and on representations of the
American Minister, the British Government ordered him to leave
the United Kingdom immediately.
</p><p>
Next he sought the ear of Napoleon; but again he was flouted and
insulted by the American diplomatic and consular representatives&mdash;he
was, they said, "a fugitive from justice." His last sou gone, ragged
and often hungry, he managed at last, by the aid of one John Reeves,
to secure passage for Boston, where he landed May 4, 1812. Then he
journeyed to New York, where he arrived June 30 in abject poverty
and utterly ruined. But still his spirit did not give way.
</p><p>
Soon, however, fate struck him the only blow that, until now, ever
had brought this iron man to his knees. His passionately beloved
little grandson, Aaron Burr Alston, died in June. In December, another
and heavier stroke fell. His daughter sailed from Charleston,
South Carolina, to join and comfort her father and be comforted by
him. Her ship was lost in a storm, and Theodosia the beautiful, the
accomplished, the adored, was drowned. Then, at last, the heart of
Aaron Burr was broken.
</p><p>
Of the many ridiculous stories told of Burr and his daughter, one
was that her ship was captured by pirates and she, ordered to walk the
plank, did so with her child in her arms "without hesitation or visible
tremor." This absurdity was given credit and currency by Harriet
Martineau. (See Martineau: <i>Western Travels</i>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 291-92.) Theodosia's
child had died six months before she sailed from Charleston to go to
her father, and she embarked in a pilot boat, about which no pirate
would have troubled himself.
</p><p>
The remainder of Burr's long life was given to the practice of his
profession. His industry, legal learning, and ability, once more secured
for him a good business. In 1824, Marshall ruled on an application
to restore an attorney named Burr to the bar of the Circuit Court of
the District of Columbia from which he had been suspended for unprofessional
conduct. (<i>Ex parte</i> Burr, 9 Wheaton, 529-31.) It has
often been erroneously supposed that this applicant was Aaron Burr:
he was, however, one Levi Burr, a local practitioner, and not related
to Aaron Burr.
</p><p>
It is characteristic of Burr that he remembered the great lawyer
who voluntarily had hastened to defend him at Richmond, and Luther
Martin&mdash;aged, infirm, and almost deranged&mdash;was taken to the
home of Aaron Burr and tenderly cared for until he died. Burr's
marriage, at the age of seventy-eight, to Madame Jumel was, on his
part, inexplicable; it was the only regrettable but not unworthy incident
of the latter years of his life. (See Shelton: <i>Jumel Mansion</i>,
170-74.)
</p><p>
Burr's New York friends were loyal to him to his very last day.
His political genius never grew dim. He early suggested and helped to
bring about the nomination of Andrew Jackson for the Presidency.
Thus did he pay the debt of gratitude for the loyalty with which the
rugged Tennesseean had championed his cause against public opinion
and Administration alike.
</p><p>
During the summer of 1836 his last illness came upon him. When
his physician said that he could live but a few hours longer, a friend
at his bedside asked the supposedly expiring man "whether in the expedition
to the Southwest he had designed a separation of the Union."
Believing himself to be dying, Burr replied: "No! I would as soon have
thought of taking possession of the moon and informing my friends
that I intended to divide it among them." To a man, his most intimate
friends believed this statement to be true.
</p><p>
Finally, on September 14, 1836, Aaron Burr died and was buried
near his father at Princeton, New Jersey, where the parent had presided
over, and the son had attended, that Alma Mater of so many
patriots, soldiers, and statesmen.
</p><p>
For two years his burial place was unmarked. Then, at night-time,
unknown friends erected over his grave a plain marble shaft, bearing
this inscription:
</p><p class="center">

Parton's <i>Life of Burr</i> is still the best story of this strange life. But
Parton must be read with great care, for he sometimes makes statements
which are difficult of verification.

A brief, engaging, and trustworthy account of the Burr episode is
<i>Aaron Burr</i>, by Isaac Jenkinson. Until the appearance of Professor
McCaleb's book, <i>The Aaron Burr Conspiracy</i>, Mr. Jenkinson's little
volume was the best on that subject. Professor McCaleb's thorough
and scholarly study is, however, the only exhaustive and reliable
narrative of that ambitious plan and the disastrous outcome of the
attempted execution of it.</p></div>

courtship of the Administration and a purpose to join the Republican
Party. His course had angered and disgusted most of his former Federalist
friends and supporters, who felt that he had deserted his declining
party in order to advance his political fortunes. If this were
true, his performance in writing the Committee report on the resolution
to expel Smith was well calculated to endear him to Jefferson.
Adams expressed his own views thus: "On most of the great national
questions now under discussion, my sense of duty leads me to support
the administration, and I find myself of course in opposition to the
federalists in general.... My political prospects are declining."
(<i>Memoirs, J. Q. A.</i>: Adams, <span class="smcap">i</span>, 497-98.)
</p><p>
The Federalist Legislature of Massachusetts grossly insulted Adams
by electing his successor before Adams's term in the Senate had
expired. Adams resigned, and in March, 1809, President Madison
appointed him Minister to Russia, and later Minister to Great
Britain. President Monroe made the former Federalist his Secretary
of State. No Republican was more highly honored by these two
Republican Presidents than was John Quincy Adams.</p></div>

of the Chief Justice, however, was the more severe because of
the unmistakable designation of him. (See <i>Writings, J. Q. A.</i>: Ford,

</p><p>
It must be remembered, too, that this attack upon Marshall comes
from the son of the man who, on January 20, 1801, appointed Marshall
Chief Justice. (See vol. <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 552-53, of this work.) But John Quincy
Adams soon came to be one of the stanchest supporters and most
ardent admirers that Marshall ever had. It was peculiarly characteristic
of Marshall that he did not resent the attack of Adams and,
for the only time in his judicial career, actually interested himself
in politics in behalf of Adams. (See vol. <span class="smcap">iv</span>, chap. <span class="smcap">ix</span>, of this work.)</p></div>

(see his letter to King, Jan. 2, 1808, King, <span class="smcap">v</span>, 44), and in a pamphlet
entitled "A Review of the Correspondence Between the Hon. John
Adams and the late William Cunningham, Esq." which he published
in 1824, Pickering wrote that the resolution "outraged ... every distinguished

Adams "indiscreet" (see his letter to Pickering, Jan. 7, 1808, King, <span class="smcap">v</span>,

New Hampshire (see <i>Mass. Historical Society Proceedings</i>, <span class="smcap">xlv</span>, 357).

<h3>FRAUD AND CONTRACT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If I were to characterize the United States, it should be by the appellation
of the land of speculation. (William Priest.)</p>

<p>By the God of Heaven, if we go on in this way, our nation will sink into disgrace
and slavery. (John Tyler.)</p>

<p>Millions of acres are easily digested by such stomachs. They buy and sell
corruption in the gross. (John Randolph.)</p>

<p>When a law is in its nature a contract, when absolute rights have vested
under that contract, a repeal of the law cannot divest those rights. The people
can act only by their agents and, within the powers conferred upon them,
their acts must be considered as the acts of the people. (Marshall.)</p></div>


<p>The Honorable William Longstreet was an active
and influential member of the Georgia Legislature
during the winter of 1794-95. He was also a practical
man. An important bill was then before that
body, and Mr. Longstreet employed effective methods
to forward its passage. The proposed legislation
was to authorize the sale to four speculating land
companies<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> of most of that territory which comprises
the present States of Alabama and Mississippi.</p>

<p>"Why are you not in favor of selling the western
lands?" frequently asked Representative Longstreet
of his fellow member, Clem Lanier. "Because I do
not think it right to sell to companies of speculators,"
was the answer. "Better vote for the bill," observed
his seat mate, Representative Henry Gindrat, one
day as they sat chatting before the Speaker of the
House took the chair. "It will be worth your while.
Senator Thomas Wylly says that he can have eight
or ten likely negroes for his part."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon Senator Wylly came to Lanier
and began to talk of the land bill. A Mr. Dennison
sauntered up. Wylly left, and the newcomer remarked
that, of course, he advised no legislator how
to vote, but he could not help noticing that all who
favored the sale of the lands "were handsomely
provided for." If Lanier should support the bill, he
would be taken care of like the rest. He was buying,
Dennison said, from members who wished to
sell lands allotted to them for agreeing to support
the measure.</p>

<p>Once more came Longstreet, who "presented a
certificate entitling the bearer to two shares of
twenty-five thousand acres each," as security that
Lanier would be rewarded if he voted for the sale
bill. The obdurate Representative, who wished to
probe the depths of the plot, objected, and Longstreet
assured him that he would immediately procure
"another certificate ... for the same number
of acres." But Lanier finally declined the bribe of
seventy-five thousand acres of land.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p>Representative Gindrat had offered to sell his
shares for one thousand dollars, the price generally
given; but, securing "a better market," declined
that sum.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a> Representative Lachlan M'Intosh received
six shares in one of the land companies, which
he sold at a premium of two hundred and fifty dollars
each.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a></p>

<p>After the bill had passed, Senator Robert Thomas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
who had no means of acquiring ready cash,<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> brought
two thousand dollars to the house where he boarded
and asked Philip Clayton, the owner, to keep it for
him. Clayton was curious&mdash;did Senator Thomas
get the money for his share of the lands? he inquired.
"It is nothing to you; take care of it," answered the
suddenly affluent legislator, smiling.<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a></p>

<p>Representative Longstreet offered Representative
John Shepperd one hundred thousand acres, but
Shepperd was not interested; then Philip Clayton,
the tavern-keeper, offered him seventy pounds to go
home for the session.<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a></p>

<p>A saturnalia of corruption was in progress in the
little village of Augusta, where the Legislature of
Georgia was in session.<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a> The leading men of that
and neighboring States were on the ground urging
the enactment of the law in which all were interested.
Wade Hampton of South Carolina was on hand.
State and National judges were present. James
Wilson of Pennsylvania, Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, was there
with twenty-five thousand dollars in bank bills.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span></p>

<p>William Smith, Judge of the Superior Court of
Georgia, added his influence, receiving for his services
as lobbyist thirteen thousand dollars. Nathaniel
Pendleton, Judge of the United States Court for
that district, urged the legislation and signed and
issued the certificates for shares that were given
to the members for their votes.<a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> Directing all
was General James Gunn, United States Senator
from Georgia: his first term in the National Senate
about to expire, he was now re&euml;lected by this very
Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a></p>

<p>A majority of Georgia's lawmaking body thus
became financially interested in the project, and
the bill passed both houses. But Governor George
Mathews vetoed the measure, because he thought
the time not propitious for selling the lands, the price
too low, the reservations for Georgians too small,
and the principle of monopoly wrong.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a> Another bill
was prepared to meet some of the Governor's objections.
This was introduced as a supplement to a law
just enacted to pay the State troops.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a> Again every
possible influence was brought upon the Legislature
to pass this bill with utmost dispatch.<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a> Some mem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>bers,
who would not support it, were induced to leave
the tiny Georgia Capital; others, who were recalcitrant,
were browbeaten and bullied.</p>

<p>Senator Gunn, the field marshal of this legislative
campaign, strode about the village arrayed in broadcloth,
top boots, and beaver hat, commending those
who favored the bill, abusing those who opposed it.
In his hand he carried a loaded whip, and with this
the burly Senator actually menaced members who
objected to the scheme.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> In a little more than one
week the bill was rushed through both houses. This
time it received the reluctant approval of the Governor,
and on January 7, 1795, became a law.</p>

<p>In such fashion was enacted the legislation which
disposed of more than thirty-five million acres of
fertile, well-watered, heavily wooded land at less
than one and one half cents an acre.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> The purchasers
were four companies known as The Georgia Company,
The Georgia Mississippi Company, The Tennessee
Company, and The Upper Mississippi Company.
The total purchase price was five hundred
thousand dollars in specie or approved currency,
one fifth to be deposited with the State Treasurer
before the passage of the act, and the remainder to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
be paid on or before November 1, 1795. The Governor
was directed to execute a deed in fee-simple to
the men composing each company as tenants in common;
and the deferred payments were secured by
mortgages to the Governor, to be immediately foreclosed
upon default of payment, and the one fifth
already deposited to be forfeited to the State.</p>

<p>Two million acres were reserved for exclusive
entry by citizens of Georgia, and the land companies
were bound to form settlements within five years
after the Indian titles had been extinguished. The
lands were declared free of taxation until they should
be so occupied that the settlers were represented in
the Legislature.<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a> Governor Mathews executed deeds
in compliance with the law, and, the entire amount
of the purchase money having been paid into the
State Treasury before November 1, the mortgages
were canceled and the transaction was closed in
accordance with the provisions of the statute. So
far as that legislation and the steps taken in pursuance
of it could bring about such a result, the legal
title to practically all of the domain stretching from
the present western boundary of Georgia to the Mississippi
River, and from the narrow strip of Spanish
territory on the Gulf to the Tennessee line, was
transferred to the men composing these four land
companies. The greatest real estate deal in history
was thus consummated.</p>

<p>But even while this bill was before the Legislature,
popular opposition to it began. A young man of
twenty-three was then teaching in a little school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>-house
at Augusta, but he was destined to become
United States Senator, Minister to France, Secretary
of the Treasury, and candidate for President.
Enraged at what he believed the despoiling of the
people by a band of robbers using robbers' methods,
young William H. Crawford hurried to his home in
Columbia County, got up a petition to the Governor
to reject the bill again, and hurried to the Capital
where he presented it to the Chief Executive of the
State.<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> But Governor Mathews, against whom no
man, then or thereafter, charged corrupt motives,
persisted in signing the measure.</p>

<p>And it must be said that the bill was not without
merit. Georgia was but thinly populated, not more
than fifty thousand human beings inhabiting its
immense extent of savanna and forest. Most of
these people were very poor<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> and unable to pay any
public charges whatever. The State Treasury was
empty; the State troops, who had been employed in
the endless Indian troubles, were unpaid and clamoring
for the money long due them; the State currency
had so depreciated that it was almost without
value. No commonwealth in the Union was in worse
financial case.<a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the titles of the Indians, who occupied
the country and who were its real owners, had not
been extinguished. Under the Constitution, the National
Government alone could deal with the tribes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
and it had long been urging Georgia to cede her
claims to the United States, as Virginia and Connecticut
had done. Indeed, the State had once offered
to make this cession, but on such terms that Congress
had refused to accept it. The purchasers now
took whatever title Georgia had, subject to these
burdens, the State to be saved from all annoyance
on account of them.</p>

<p>The tribes were powerful and brave, and they had
been prompt and bold in the defense of their lands.
The Creeks alone could put nearly six thousand
fighting men in the field, and the Choctaws had
more than four thousand trained warriors.<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> The
feeble and impoverished State had never been able
to subdue them, or to enforce in the slightest degree
the recognition of the State's title to the country
they inhabited. Georgia's right to their lands "depended
on her power to dispossess the Indians; but
however good the title might be, the State would
have been fortunate to make it a free gift to any
authority strong enough to deal with the Creeks and
Cherokees alone."<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a></p>

<p>The sale of the territory was not a new or novel
project. Six years earlier the State had disposed of
twenty-five million five hundred thousand acres of
the same territory to four land companies on much
poorer terms.<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> Jefferson, then Secretary of State,
rendered a careful opinion on the right of Georgia to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
make the grant.<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> These purchasers had tendered
payment in South Carolina and Continental scrip
that was practically worthless; the Treasurer of
Georgia had properly refused to accept it; and there
ended the transaction as far as the State was concerned.
A suit was later brought against Georgia by
the grantees<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> to compel the performance of the contract;
but the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution
thwarted that legal plan. So these speculators
dropped the matter until the sale just described
was made to the new companies six years
later.</p>

<p>The most active promoters of the first purchasing
companies, in 1789, were mere adventurers, although
at first Patrick Henry and other men of honor and
repute were interested in the speculation. Henry,
however, soon withdrew.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a> The consummation of
their deal with Georgia required the payment of
sound money and <i>bona-fide</i> settlement by actual
tillers of the soil. Also, the adventurers got into
trouble with the Indians, became gravely involved
in Spanish intrigue, and collided with the National
Government;<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> so the enterprise lost, for a time, all
attractiveness for these speculators.</p>

<p>The new land companies, on the other hand, were
for the most part composed of men of excellent reputations.<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>
At the head of the largest, The Georgia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
Company, were United States Senator James Gunn
and United States Attorney for the District of
Georgia, Mathew McAlister; associated with them,
in addition to Judges Stith and Pendleton, and Justice
Wilson, were Robert Goodloe Harper, Representative
in Congress from Maryland, Robert Morris,
the financier of the Revolution, and others of substance
and position.<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> Also, as has been stated, they
paid for their lands in the money called for by the
act&mdash;the best money then circulating in America.
The first sales of Indian lands to which Georgia
claimed title were known as the "Yazoo" speculation,
and this designation stuck to the second transaction.</p>

<p>In the six years that had intervened between the
sales to the irresponsible land-jobbers of 1789 and
the solvent investors of 1795, an event of world importance
had occurred which doubled and trebled
the value of all cotton-bearing soil. Eli Whitney, a
Connecticut school-teacher twenty-seven years of
age, had gone to Georgia in 1792 to act as a private
tutor. Finding the position taken, he studied law
while the guest of the widow of General Nathanael
Greene. This discerning woman, perceiving that
the young man was gifted with inventive genius,
set him to work on a device for separating cotton
from the seed. The machine was built, and worked
perfectly. The news of it traveled with astonishing
rapidity throughout Georgia and the South. The
model was stolen; and so simple was the construction
of it that everywhere in cotton-growing lands it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
was freely reproduced by planters great and small.
The vast sweep of territory stretching from Georgia
to the Father of Waters, the best cotton land in the
world, thus rose in value as if the wand of a financial
deity had been waved over it. Settlers poured into
Georgia by the thousand, and Indian atrocities were
now as little feared as Indian rights were respected.<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a></p>

<p>The purchase of the unoccupied Georgia lands by
the <i>bona-fide</i>, if piratical, land companies of 1795
became, therefore, an adventure far more valuable
in possibilities for the investors, and incomparably
more attractive in the probability of political advantage
to those who resisted it, than the innocuous and
unopposed sale to the Yazoo swindlers of six years
previous.</p>

<p>So it fell out that the mechanical genius of Eli
Whitney, in 1793, called into action, exactly eighteen
years afterward, the judicial genius of John Marshall.
His opinion in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck was one of the first
steps toward the settling of the law of public contract
in the riotous young Republic&mdash;one of the
earliest and strongest judicial assertions of the supremacy
of Nationalism over Localism. And never
more than at that particular time did an established
rule on these vital subjects so need to be announced
by the highest judicial authority.</p>

<p>Since before the Revolution, all men had fixed
their eyes, hopes, and purposes upon land. Not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
humble and needy only, but the high-placed and
opulent, had looked to the soil&mdash;the one as their
chief source of livelihood, and the other as a means
of profitable speculation. Indeed, dealing in land
was the most notable economic fact in the early
years of the American Nation. "Were I to characterize
the <i>United States</i>," chronicles one of the
most acute British travelers and observers of the
time, "it should be by the appellation of the <i>land of
speculation</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a></p>

<p>From the Nation's beginning, the States had lax
notions as to the sacredness of public contracts, and
often violated the obligations of them.<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> Private
agreements stood on a somewhat firmer basis, but
even these were looked upon with none too ardent
favor. The most familiar forms of contract-breaking
were the making legal tender of depreciated paper,
and the substitution of property for money; but other
devices were also resorted to. So it was that the provision,
"no state shall pass any law impairing the
obligation of contracts," was placed in the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>
The effect of this on the public mind, as re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>ported
by conservatives like Marshall, is stated in
the <i>Commercial Gazette</i> of Boston, January 28, 1799:
"State laws protected debtors" when they "were
citizens ... [and] the creditors foreigners. The federal
constitution, prohibiting the states to clear off debts
<i>without payment</i>, by exacting <i>justice</i>, seemed ... to
establish <i>oppression</i>." The debtors, therefore, "pronounced
... the <i>equal</i> reign of law and debt-compelling
justice, the beginning of an insidious attack on
liberty and the erection of aristocracy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span></p>

<p>The "contract clause" of the Constitution was
now to be formally challenged by a "sovereign"
State for the first time since the establishment of
the National Government. Georgia was to assert
her "sovereignty" by the repudiation of her laws
and the denial of contractual rights acquired under
them. And this she was to do with every apparent
consideration of morality and public justice to support
her.</p>

<p>The tidings of the corruption attending the second
"Yazoo" sale were carried over the State on the
wings of fury. A transaction which six years before
had met with general acquiescence,<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a> now received
deep-throated execration. The methods by which
the sale was pushed through the Legislature maddened
the people, and their wrath was increased by
the knowledge that the invention of the Connecticut
schoolmaster had tremendously enhanced the value
of every acre of cotton-bearing soil.</p>

<p>Men who lived near Augusta assembled and
marched on the Capital determined to lynch their
legislative betrayers. Only the pleadings of members
who had voted against the bill saved the lives of
their guilty associates.<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> Meetings were held in every
hamlet. Shaggy backwoodsmen met in "old-field"
log schoolhouses and denounced "the steal." The
burning in effigy of Senator Gunn became a favorite
manifestation of popular wrath. The public indignation
was strengthened by the exercise of it. Those
responsible for the enactment of the law found it
perilous to be seen in any crowd. One member left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
the State. Another escaped hanging only by precipitate
flight.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> Scores of resolutions were passed by
town, rural, and backwoods assemblages demanding
that the fraudulent statute be rescinded. Petitions,
circulated from the "mansion" of the wealthy
planter to the squalid cabin of the poorest white
man, were signed by high and low alike. The grand
juries of every county in Georgia, except two, formally
presented as a grievance the passage of the
land sale act of 1795.</p>

<p>Among other things, the land sale act required
the Senators and Representatives of Georgia in
Congress to urge the National Government to speed
the making of a treaty with the Indian tribes extinguishing
their title to the lands which the State had
sold. Upon receiving a copy of the nefarious law,
Senator James Jackson of Georgia laid it before
the Senate, together with a resolution declaring that
that body would "advise and consent" to the President's
concluding any arrangement that would divest
the Indians of their claims.<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a></p>

<p>But although he had full knowledge of the methods
by which the act was passed, the records do
not show that Jackson then gave the slightest expression
to that indignation which he so soon thereafter
poured forth. Nor is there any evidence that
he said a word on the subject when, on March 2,
1795, Georgia's title again came before the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
Some time afterward, however, Senator Jackson
hurried home and put himself at the head of the
popular movement against the "Yazoo Frauds."
In every corner of the State, from seaport to remotest
settlement, his fiery eloquence roused the
animosity of the people to still greater frenzy. In two
papers then published in Georgia, the <i>Savannah
Gazette</i> and the <i>Augusta Chronicle</i>, the Senator, under
the <i>nom de guerre</i> of "Sicillius," published a series
of articles attacking with savage violence the sale
law and all connected with the enactment of it.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a></p>

<p>It came out that every member of the Legislature
who had voted for the measure, except one,<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> had
shares of stock in the purchasing companies.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> Stories
of the extent of the territory thus bartered away
kept pace with tales of the venality by which the
fraud was effected. Bad as the plain facts were,
they became simply monstrous when magnified by
the imagination of the public.</p>

<p>Nearly every man elected<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> to the new Legislature
was pledged to vote for the undoing of the fraud in
any manner that might seem the most effective.
Senator Jackson had resigned from the National
Senate in order to become a member of the Georgia
House of Representatives; and to this office he
was overwhelmingly elected. When the Legislature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
convened in the winter of 1795-96, it forthwith went
about the task of destroying the corrupt work of its
predecessor. Jackson was the undisputed leader;<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>
his associates passed, almost unanimously, and
Governor Irwin promptly approved, the measure
which Jackson wrote.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> Thus was produced that
enactment by a "sovereign" State, the validity of
which John Marshall was solemnly to deny from the
Supreme Bench of the Nation.</p>

<p>Jackson's bill was a sprightly and engaging document.
The preamble was nearly three times as long
as the act itself, and abounded in interminable sentences.
It denounced the land sale act as a violation
of both State and National Constitutions, as the
creation of a monopoly, as the dismemberment of
Georgia, as the betrayal of the rights of man. In this
fashion the "whereases" ran on for some thousands
of words. On second thought the Legislature concluded
that the law was worse than unconstitutional&mdash;it
was, the "whereases" declared, a "usurped act."
That part of the preamble dealing with the mingled
questions of fraud and State sovereignty deserves
quotation in full:</p>

<p>"And Whereas," ran this exposition of Constitutional
law and of the nature of contracts, "divested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
of all fundamental and constitutional authority
which the said usurped act might be declared by
its advocates, and those who claim under it, to be
founded on, fraud has been practised to obtain it
and the grants under it; and it is a fundamental
principle, both of law and equity, that there cannot
be a wrong without a remedy, and the State and the
citizens thereof have suffered a most grievous injury
in the barter of their rights by the said usurped act
and grants, and there is no court existing, if the dignity
of the State would permit her entering one, for
the trial of fraud and collusion of individuals, or to
contest her sovereignty with them, whereby the
remedy for so notorious an injury could be obtained;
and it can no where better lie than with the representatives
of the people chosen by them, after due promulgation
by the grand juries of most of the counties
of the State, of the means practised, and by the
remonstrances of the people of the convention, held on
the 10th day of May, in the year 1795, setting forth
the atrocious peculation, corruption, and collusion,
by which the usurped act and grants were obtained."<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a></p>

<p>At last the now highly enlightened Legislature
enacted "that the said usurped act ... be declared
null and void," and that all claims directly or indirectly
arising therefrom be "annulled." The
lands sold under the Act of 1795 were pronounced
to be "the sole property of the State, subject only
to the right of treaty of the United States, to enable
the State to purchase, under its pre-emption right,
the Indian title to the same."<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the law which John Marshall was to
declare invalid in one of the most far-reaching opinions
ever delivered from the Supreme Bench.</p>

<p>The Legislature further enacted that the "usurped
act" and all "records, documents, and deeds" connected
with the Yazoo fraud, "shall be expunged
from the face and indexes of the books of record of
the State, and the enrolled law or usurped act shall
then be publicly burnt, in order that no trace of so
unconstitutional, vile, and fraudulent a transaction,
other than the infamy attached to it by this law,
shall remain in the public offices thereof." County
officials were, under the severest of penalties for
disobedience, directed to "obliterate" all records
of deeds or other instruments connected with the
anathematized grants, and courts were forbidden to
receive any evidence of title of any kind whatever
to lands from the grantees under the "usurped act."<a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a></p>

<p>The Governor was directed to issue warrants for
repayment to those who, in good faith, had deposited
their purchase money, with this reservation, however:
"Provided the same shall be now therein."<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a>
After six months all moneys not applied for were to
become the property of Georgia. To prevent frauds
upon individuals who might otherwise purchase
lands from the pirate companies, the Governor was
directed to promulgate this brief and simple act
"throughout the United States."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span></p>

<p>A committee, appointed to devise a method for
destroying the records, immediately reported that
this should be done by cutting out of the books the
leaves containing them. As to the enrolled bill containing
the "usurped act," an elaborate performance
was directed to be held: "A fire shall be made in
front of the State House door, and a line formed by
the members of both branches around the same.
The Secretary of State<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> ... shall then produce the
enrolled bill and usurped act from among the archives
of the State and deliver the same to the President
of the Senate, who shall examine the same, and
shall then deliver the same to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives for like examination; and
the Speaker shall then deliver them to the Clerk of
the House of Representatives, who shall read aloud
the title to the same, and shall then deliver them to
Messenger of the House, who shall then pronounce&mdash;'<span class="smcap">God
save the State!! And long preserve her
rights!! And may every attempt to injure
them perish as these corrupt acts now do!!!!</span>'"<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a></p>

<p>Every detail of this play was carried out with all
theatrical effect. Indeed, so highly wrought were the
imaginations of actors and onlookers that, at the
last moment, a final dash of color was added. Some
one gifted with dramatic genius suggested that the
funeral pyre of such unholy legislation should not be
lighted by earthly hands, but by fire from Heaven.
A sun-glass was produced; Senator Jackson held it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
above the fagots and the pile was kindled from "the
burning rays of the lidless eye of justice."<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a></p>

<p>While the State was still in convulsions of anger,
a talented young Virginian of impressionable temperament
went to Georgia upon a visit to a college
friend, Joseph Bryan, and was so profoundly moved
by accounts of the attempt to plunder the State,
that a hatred of the corrupt plot and of all connected
with it became an obsession that lasted as
long as he lived.<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> Thus was planted in the soul of
John Randolph that determination which later,
when a member of Congress, caused him to attack
the Administration of Thomas Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a></p>

<p>Swift as was the action of the people and legislature
of Georgia in attempting to recover the Yazoo
lands, it was not so speedy as that of the speculators
in disposing of them to purchasers in other States.
Most of these investors bought in entire good faith
and were "innocent purchasers." Some, however,
must have been thoroughly familiar with the fraud.<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
The most numerous sales were made in the Middle
States and in New England. The land companies
issued a prospectus,<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> setting out their title, which
appeared to be, and indeed really was, legally perfect.
Thousands of copies of this pamphlet were
scattered among provident and moneyed people.
Agents of the companies truthfully described the
Yazoo country to be rich, the climate mild and
healthful, and the land certain of large and rapid
rise in value.</p>

<p>Three of the companies<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> opened an office in Boston,
where the spirit of speculation was rampant.
Then ensued an epidemic of investment. Throngs
of purchasers gathered at the promoters' offices.
Each day prices rose and the excitement increased.
Buying and selling of land became the one absorbing
business of those who had either money or credit.
Some of the most prominent and responsible men in
New England acquired large tracts.<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> The companies
received payment partly in cash, but chiefly in
notes which were speedily sold in the market for
commercial paper. Sales were made in other Northern
cities, and many foreigners became purchasers.
The average price received was fourteen cents an
acre.<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p>Some New Englanders were suspicious. "The
Georgia land speculation calls for vigor in Congress.
Near fifty millions acres sold ... for a song," wrote
Fisher Ames.<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> But such cautious men as Ames were
few in number and most of them were silent. By
the time reports reached Boston that the Legislature
of Georgia was about to repeal the act under which
the companies had bought the lands, numerous sales,
great and small, had been made. In that city alone
more than two millions of dollars had been invested,
and this had been paid or pledged by "every class
of men, even watch-makers, hair-dressers, and mechanics."
The Georgia Company conveyed eleven
million acres on the very day that the Legislature
of Georgia passed the bill declaring the "usurped
act" to be null and void and asserting the title of
the whole territory still to be in the State.<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a></p>

<p>Three weeks later, the news of the enactment of
the rescinding law was published in the New England
metropolis. Anger and apprehension seized the investors.
If this legislation were valid, all would lose
heavily; some would be financially ruined. So a
large number of the purchasers organized the New
England Mississippi Company for the purpose of
defending their interests. A written opinion upon
the validity of their titles was procured from Alexander
Hamilton, who was then practicing law in New
York and directing the Federalist Party throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
the Nation. He was still regarded by most Federalists,
and by nearly all moneyed men, as the soundest
lawyer, as well as the ablest statesman, in America.</p>

<p>Hamilton's opinion was brief, simple, convincing,
and ideally constructed for perusal by investors. It
stated the facts of the enactment of the sale law,
the fulfillment of the conditions of it by the purchasers,
and the passage of the rescinding act.
Hamilton declared this latter act to be invalid because
it plainly violated the contract clause of the
Constitution. "Every grant ... whether [from] ... a
state or an individual, is virtually a contract." The
rescinding act was therefore null, and "the courts
of the United States ... will be likely to pronounce
it so."<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a></p>

<p>Soon after its passage, President Washington had
received a copy of the Georgia land sale act. He
transmitted it to Congress with a short Message,<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>
stating that the interests of the United States
were involved. His principal concern, however, and
that of Congress also, was about the Indians. It
was feared that depredations by whites would cause
another outbreak of the natives. A resolution was
adopted authorizing the President to obtain from
Georgia the cession of her "claim to the whole or any
part of the land within the ... Indian boundaries,"
and recommending that he prevent the making of
treaties by individuals or States "for the extinguishment
of the Indian title." But not a word was said
in Washington's Message, or in the debate in Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>gress,
about the invalidity of the Georgia sale law
or the corrupt methods employed to secure the enactment
of it.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a></p>

<p>Two bills to protect the Indians failed of passage.<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>
Just before adjournment the House adopted a Senate
resolution which had been offered by Senator Rufus
King of New York, requesting that the Attorney-General
report to the Senate all data bearing on
Georgia's title to the territory sold to the land
companies; but again the invalidity of the sale law
was not even suggested, and the corruption of the
Georgia Legislature was not so much as referred to.<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a></p>

<p>A year later, Charles Lee, Washington's Attorney-General,
transmitted to Congress an exhaustive report
containing all facts.<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> This report was referred
to a special committee, headed by Senator Aaron
Burr of New York, who, on May 20, 1796, reported
a resolution authorizing the President to treat with
Georgia for the cession of the territory.<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> Once more
no attention was paid to the fraud in the sale act,
or to the rescinding act of the Georgia Legislature.</p>

<p>But when the public finally learned of the "Yazoo
Fraud" and of the repudiation by the Georgia Legislature
of the corrupt law, the whole country was
deeply stirred. A war of pamphlets broke out and
was waged by both sides with vigor and ability.
Abraham Bishop of New Haven, Connecticut, wrote
a comprehensive answer to the prospectus of the
land companies, and copies of this pamphlet, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
appeared in four parts, were widely circulated.<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a>
Georgia had no fee in the lands, said Bishop.<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> Sales
to "innocent purchasers" could not give them what
Georgia had no right to sell. Neither could such a
device validate fraud. Much litigation had already
grown out of the swindle, and the Georgia rescinding
act had "brought ... matters to a crisis, and one
decision of the supreme court of the United States
may probably influence the decisions of lower
courts."<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> Bishop discussed brilliantly, and at length,
every possible question involved. The power of the
State to pass and repeal laws was "wholly uncontrolable,"<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a>
he asserted. The history of other dishonest
and imprudent speculations was examined&mdash;the
South Sea Bubble, the Mississippi Bubble,<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a> and the
interposition of the legislative power of Great Britain
in the one case and of France in the other. Should
like power be denied in America? Georgia's rescinding
act "nipt in the bud a number of aspiring swindlers."<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a>
Courts could not overthrow such legislation.
The "sacredness of contracts" was the favorite cloak
of fraud. Bishop urged buyers to resist the recovery
of money pledged in their purchase notes and,
by so doing, to restore "millions of dollars ... to the
channels of industry."<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a></p>

<p>Hard upon the publication of the first number of
Bishop's pamphlet followed one for the land companies
and investors. This had been written by
Robert Goodloe Harper of Maryland a few months
after Hamilton had rendered his opinion that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
Georgia grant was inviolable.<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a> It was an able and
learned performance. The title of Georgia to the
lands was carefully examined and held to be indefeasible.
The sale of 1795 was set forth and the fact disclosed
that Georgia had appropriated one hundred
thousand dollars of the purchase money immediately
upon the receipt of it.<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> It was pointed out that the
rescinding act ignored this fact.<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a></p>

<p>Harper argued that only the courts could determine
the validity and meaning of a law, and that no
Legislature could annul a grant made by a previous
one. To the Judiciary alone belonged that power.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>
The sale law was a contract, fully executed; one
party to it could not break that compact.<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> If Georgia
thought the sale act unconstitutional, she should
have brought suit in the United States Court to
determine that purely judicial question. The same
was true as to the allegations of fraud and corruption
in the passage of the measure. If any power
could do so, the courts and they alone could decide
the effect of fraud in procuring the enactment of a
law. But even the courts were barred from investigating
that question: if laws could be invalidated
because of the motives of members of lawmaking
bodies, "what a door would be opened to fraud and
uncertainty of every kind!"<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, after a long altercation that lasted for
nearly three years, Congress enacted a law authorizing
the appointment of commissioners to settle the
disputes between the National Government and
Georgia, and also to secure from that truculent
sovereignty the cession to the Nation of the lands
claimed by the State.<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> In the somewhat extended
debate over the bill but little was said about the
invalidity of the Yazoo sale, and the corruption of
the Legislature that directed it to be made was not
mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a></p>

<p>Under this act of Congress, Georgia ceded her
rights over the disputed territory for one million,
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars; provided,
however, that the Nation should extinguish the
Indian titles, settle British and Spanish claims, ulti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>mately
admit the vast domain as a State of the
Union, and reserve five million acres for the purpose
of quieting all other demands. A later law<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>  directed
the National commissioners, who had negotiated this
arrangement with Georgia, to investigate and report
upon the claims of individuals and companies to
lands within the territory thus ceded to the United
States.</p>

<p>At once the purchasers from the land companies,
especially the New England investors, besieged Congress
to devote part of this five million acres to the
salvage of their imperiled money. The report of the
commissioners<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> was wise, just, and statesmanlike.
It was laid before the House on February 16, 1803.
Although the titles of the claimants could "not be
supported," still, because most of the titles had been
acquired in good faith, and because it would be injurious
to everybody, including the Nation, to leave
the matter unsettled, the report recommended the
accommodation of the dispute on terms that would
save innocent purchasers at least a part of the
money they had paid or legally engaged to pay.<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p>

<p>When a bill to carry out the recommendations of
the commission for the payment of the Yazoo claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>ants
came before the House, John Randolph offered
a resolution that went directly to the heart of the
controversy and of all subsequent ones of like nature.
It declared that "when the governors of any people
shall have betrayed" their public trust for their own
corrupt advantage, it is the "inalienable right" of
that people "to abrogate the act thus endeavoring
to betray them." Accordingly the Legislature of
Georgia had passed the rescinding act. This was
entirely legal and constitutional because "a subsequent
Legislature of an individual State has an undoubted
right to repeal any act of a preceding Legislature,
provided such repeal be not forbidden by the
constitution of such State, or of the United States."
Neither the fundamental law of Georgia nor of the
Nation forbade the repeal of the corrupt law of 1795.
Claims under this nullified and "usurped" law were
not recognized by the compact of cession between
Georgia and the United States, "nor by any act
of the Federal Government." Therefore, declared
Randolph's resolution, "no part of the five millions
of acres reserved for satisfying and quieting claims
... shall be appropriated to quiet or compensate any
claims" derived under the corrupt legislation of the
Georgia Legislature of 1795.<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> After a hot fight, consideration
of the resolutions was postponed until the
next session; but the bill authorizing the commissioners
to compromise with the Yazoo claimants also
went over.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a></p>

<p>The matter next came up for consideration in the
House, just before the trial in the Senate of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase. A strong and
influential lobby was pressing the compromise. The
legislative agents of the New England Mississippi
Company<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> presented its case with uncommon ability.
In a memorial to Congress<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> they set forth their
repeated applications to President, Congress, and
the commissioners for protection. They were, they
said, "constantly assured" that the rights of the
claimants would be respected; and that it was expressly
for this purpose that the five million acres
had been reserved. For years they had attended
sittings of the commissioners and sessions of Congress
"at great cost and heavy expense."</p>

<p>Would not Congress at last afford them relief? If a
"judicial decision" was desired, let Congress enact a
law directing the Supreme Court to decide as to the
validity of their title and they would gladly submit
the matter to that tribunal. It was only because Congress
seemed to prefer settlement by compromise that
they again presented the facts and reasons for establishing
their rights. So once more every aspect of the
controversy was discussed with notable ability and
extensive learning in Granger and Morton's brochure.<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span></p>

<p>The passions of John Randolph, which had never
grown cold since as a youth, a decade previously, he
had witnessed the dramatic popular campaign in
Georgia&mdash;and which during 1804 had been gathering
intense heat&mdash;now burst into a furious flame.
Unfortunately for Jefferson, the most influential agent
of the New England claimants was the one Administration
official who had most favors to bestow&mdash;Gideon
Granger of Connecticut, the Postmaster-General.<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a>
He was the leader of the lobby which the
New England Mississippi Company had mustered in
such force. And Granger now employed all the power
of his department, so rich in contracts and offices, to
secure the passage of a bill that would make effectual
the recommendations of Jefferson's commissioners.</p>

<p>As the vote upon it drew near, Granger actually
appeared upon the floor of the House soliciting votes
for the measure. Randolph's emotions were thus
excited to the point of frenzy&mdash;the man was literally
beside himself with anger. He needed to husband
all his strength for the conduct of the trial of
Chase<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> and to solidify his party, rather than to waste
his physical resources, or to alienate a single Republican.
On the report of the Committee of Claims
recommending the payment of the Yazoo claimants,
one of the most virulent and picturesque debates
in the history of the American Congress began.<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a>
Randolph took the floor, and a "fire and brimstone
speech"<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> he made.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p><p>"Past experience has shown that this is one of
those subjects which pollution has sanctified," he
began. "The press is gagged." The New England
claimants innocent purchasers! "Sir, when that act
of stupendous villainy was passed in 1795 ... it
caused a sensation scarcely less violent than that
produced by the passage of the stamp act." Those
who assert their ignorance of "this infamous act"
are gross and willful liars.<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> To a "monstrous anomaly"
like the present case, cried Randolph, "narrow
maxims of municipal jurisprudence ought not, and
cannot be applied.... Attorneys and judges do not
decide the fate of empires."<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a></p>

<p>Randolph mercilessly attacked Granger, and
through him the Administration itself. Granger's
was a practiced hand at such business, he said. He
was one of "the applicants by whom we were beset"
in the Connecticut Reserve scheme, "by which the
nation were swindled out of some three or four millions
of acres of land, which, like other bad titles,
had fallen into the hands of innocent purchasers."
Granger "seems to have an unfortunate knack of
buying bad titles. His gigantic grasp embraces with
one hand the shores of Lake Erie,<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> and stretches
with the other to the Bay of Mobile.<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> Millions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
acres are easily digested by such stomachs.... They
buy and sell corruption in the gross." They gamble
for "nothing less than the patrimony of the people."
Pointing his long, bony finger at Granger, Randolph
exclaimed: "Mr. Speaker, ... this same agent is at
the head of an Executive department of our Government....
This officer, possessed of how many
snug appointments and fat contracts, let the voluminous
records on your table, of the mere names
and dates and sums declare, ... this officer presents
himself at your bar, at once a party and an advocate."<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a></p>

<p>The debate continued without interruption for
four full days. Every phase of the subject was discussed
exhaustively. The question of the power of
the Legislature to annul a contract; of the power
of the Judiciary to declare a legislative act void because
of corruption in the enactment of it; the competency
of Congress to pass upon such disputed
points&mdash;these questions, as well as that of the innocence
of the purchasers, were elaborately argued.</p>

<p>The strongest speech in support of the good faith
of the New England investors was made by that
venerable and militant Republican and Jeffersonian,
John Findley of Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a> He pointed out that
the purchase by members of the Georgia Legislature
of the lands sold was nothing unusual&mdash;everybody
knew "that had been the case in Pennsylvania and
other states." Georgia papers did not circulate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
New England; how could the people of that section
know of the charges of corruption and the denial of
the validity of the law under which the lands were
sold?</p>

<p>Those innocent purchasers had a right to trust
the validity of the title of the land companies&mdash;the
agents had exhibited the deeds executed by the Governor
of Georgia, the law directing the sale to be
made, and the Constitution of the State. What more
could be asked? "The respectability of the characters
of the sellers" was a guarantee "that they
could not themselves be deceived and would not
deceive others." Among these, said Findley, was an
eminent Justice of the Supreme Court,<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> a United
States Senator,<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> and many other men of hitherto
irreproachable standing. Could people living in an
old and thickly settled State, far from the scene of
the alleged swindle, with no knowledge whatever
that fraud had been charged, and in need of the
land offered&mdash;could they possibly so much as suspect
corruption when such men were members of the
selling companies?</p>

<p>Moreover, said Findley&mdash;and with entire accuracy&mdash;not
a Georgia official charged with venality
had been impeached or indicted. The truth was
that if the Georgia Legislature had not passed the
rescinding act the attention of Congress would never
have been called to the alleged swindle. Then, too,
everybody knew "that one session of a Legislature
cannot annul the contracts made by the preceding
session"; for did not the National Constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
forbid any State from passing a law impairing the
obligation of contracts?<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a></p>

<p>Randolph outdid himself in daring and ferocity
when he again took the floor. His speech struck hostile
spectators as "more outrageous than the first."<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>
He flatly charged that a mail contract had been
offered to a member of the House, who had accepted
it, but that it had been withdrawn from him when he
refused to agree to support the compromise of the
Yazoo claims. Randolph declared that the plot to
swindle Georgia out of her lands "was hatched in
Philadelphia and New York (and I believe Boston....)
and the funds with which it was effected
were principally furnished by moneyed capitalists in
those towns."<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a></p>

<p>At last the resolution was adopted by a majority
of 63 to 58,<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> and Randolph, physically exhausted and
in despair at his overthrow as dictator of the House,
went to his ineffective management of the Chase
impeachment trial.<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a> He prevented for the time being,
however, the passage of the bill to carry out the
compromise with the Yazoo claimants. He had
mightily impressed the people, especially those of
Virginia. The Richmond <i>Enquirer</i>, on October 7,
1806, denounced the Yazoo fraud and the compromise
of the investors' claims as a "stupendous
scheme of plunder." Senator Giles, in a private conversation
with John Quincy Adams, asserted that
"not a man from that State, who should give any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
countenance to the proposed compromise, could obtain
an election after it." He avowed that "nothing
since the Government existed had so deeply
affected him."<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a></p>

<p>The debate was published fully in the newspapers
of Washington, and it is impossible that Marshall
did not read it and with earnest concern. As has
already been stated, the first case involving the sale
of these Georgia lands had been dropped because of
the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing
the right to sue a state in the National courts.
Moreover, Marshall was profoundly interested in
the stability of contractual obligations. The repudiation
of these by the Legislature of Virginia had powerfully
and permanently influenced his views upon
this subject.<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> Also, Marshall's own title to part of
the Fairfax estate had more than once been in
jeopardy.<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a> At that very moment a suit affecting the
title of his brother to certain Fairfax lands was
pending in Virginia courts, and the action of the
Virginia Court of Appeals in one of these was soon
to cause the first great conflict between the highest
court of a State and the supreme tribunal of the
Nation.<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> No man in America, therefore, could have
followed with deeper anxiety the Yazoo controversy
than did John Marshall.</p>

<p>Again and again, session after session, the claimants
presented to Congress their prayers for relief.
In 1805, Senator John Quincy Adams of Massachu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>setts
and Senator Thomas Sumter of South Carolina
urged the passage of a bill to settle the claims. This
led Senator James Jackson of Georgia to deliver "a
violent invective against the claims, without any
specific object."<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> After Jackson's death the measure
passed the Senate by a vote of 19 to 11, but was
rejected in the House by a majority of 8 out of a
total of 116.<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a></p>

<p>Among the lawyers who went to Washington for
the New England Mississippi Company was a young
man not yet thirty years of age, Joseph Story of
Massachusetts, who on his first visit spent much
time with Madison, Gallatin, and the President.<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>
On a second visit, Story asked to address the House
on the subject, but that body refused to hear him.<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a></p>

<p>From the first the New England investors had
wished for a decision by the courts upon the validity
of their titles and upon the effect of the rescinding
act of the Georgia Legislature; but no way had
occurred to them by which they could secure such
a determination from the bench. The Eleventh
Amendment prevented them from suing Georgia;
and the courts of that State were, as we have seen,
forbidden by the rescinding act from entertaining
such actions.</p>

<p>To secure a judicial expression, the Boston claimants
arranged a "friendly" suit in the United States<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
Court for the District of Massachusetts. One John
Peck of Boston had been a heavy dealer in Georgia
lands.<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a> On May 14, 1803, he had either sold or pretended
to sell to one Robert Fletcher of Amherst,
New Hampshire, fifteen thousand acres of his holdings
for the sum of three thousand dollars. Immediately
Fletcher brought suit against Peck for the
recovery of this purchase money; but the case was
"continued by consent" for term after term from
June, 1803, until October, 1806.<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a></p>

<p>The pleadings<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a> set forth every possible phase of the
entire subject which could be considered judicially.
Issues were joined on all points except that of the
title of Georgia to the lands sold.<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> On this question
a jury, at the October term, 1806, returned as a special
verdict a learned and bulky document. It recited
the historical foundations of the title to the territory
in dispute; left the determination of the question to
the court; and, in case the judge should decide that
Georgia's claim to the lands sold was not valid, found
for the plaintiff and assessed his damages at the
amount alleged to have been paid to Peck.</p>

<p>Thereafter the case was again "continued by consent"
until October, 1807, when Associate Justice
William Cushing of the Supreme Court, sitting as
Circuit Judge, decided in Peck's favor every question
raised by the pleadings and by the jury's special
verdict. Fletcher sued out a writ of error to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
Supreme Court of the United States, and so this controversy
came before John Marshall. The case was
argued twice, the first time, March 1-4, 1809, by
Luther Martin for Fletcher and by Robert Goodloe
Harper and John Quincy Adams for Peck. There
was no decision on the merits because of a defect
of pleadings which Marshall permitted counsel to
remedy.<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a></p>

<p>During this argument the court adjourned for
two hours to attend the inauguration of James
Madison. For the third time Marshall administered
the Presidential oath. At the ball that night, Judge
Livingston told Adams that the court had been
reluctant "to decide the case at all, as it appeared
manifestly made up for the purpose of getting the
Court's judgment upon all the points." The Chief
Justice himself had mentioned the same thing to
Cranch.</p>

<p>Adams here chronicles an incident of some importance.
After delivering the court's opinion on
the pleadings, Marshall "added verbally, that, circumstanced
as the Court are, only five judges attending,<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>
there were difficulties which would have
prevented them from giving any opinion at this term
had the pleadings been correct; and the Court the
more readily forbore giving it, as from the complexion
of the pleadings they could not but see that
at the time when the covenants were made the
parties had notice of the acts covenanted against."<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a></p>

<p>The cause was argued again a year later. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
time Joseph Story, so soon thereafter appointed an
Associate Justice, took the place of John Quincy
Adams. Martin's address was technical and, from
the record, appears to have been perfunctory.<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> On
behalf of Peck, two thirds of the argument for the
soundness of his title was devoted to the demonstration
of the validity of that of Georgia. If that were
sound, said Story, the Legislature had a right to sell
the land, and a subsequent Legislature could not cancel
the contract when executed. The Judiciary alone
could declare what a law is or had been. Moreover,
the National Constitution expressly forbade a State
to pass an act impairing the obligation of contracts.
To overthrow a law because it was corruptly enacted
"would open a source of litigation which could never
be closed." However, "the parties now before the
court are innocent of the fraud, if any has been practiced.
They were bona fide purchasers, for a valuable
consideration, without notice of fraud. They
cannot be affected by it."<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>On March 16, 1810, Marshall delivered the opinion
of the majority of the Supreme Court. In this he
laid the second stone in the structure of American
Constitutional law which bears his name. He held
that the Georgia rescinding act was a violation of
the contract clause of the Constitution and in doing
so asserted that courts cannot examine the motives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
that induce legislators to pass a law. In arriving at
these profoundly important conclusions his reasoning
was as follows:</p>

<p>Did the Georgia sale act of 1795 violate the Constitution
of that State? An act of a legislature was
not to be set aside "lightly" on "vague conjecture"
or "slight implication." There was no ground for
asserting that the Georgia Legislature transcended
its constitutional powers in passing the sale act.<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a>
Had the corruption of the Legislature destroyed the
title of Peck, an innocent purchaser? It was, cautiously
said Marshall, doubtful "how far the validity
of a law depends upon the motives of its framers,"
particularly when the act challenged authorized
a contract that was executed according to the terms
of it. Even if such legislation could be set aside on
the ground of fraud in the enactment of it, to what
extent must the impurity go?</p>

<p>"Must it be direct corruption, or would interest
or undue influence of any kind be sufficient? Must
the vitiating cause operate on a majority, or on what
number of the members? Would the act be null,
whatever might be the wish of the nation, or would
its obligation or nullity depend upon the public sentiment?"</p>

<p>The State of Georgia did not bring this action;
nor, "by this count" of the complaint, did it appear
that the State was dissatisfied. On the face of the
pleadings a purchaser of Georgia land declares that
the seller had no title because "some of the members
of the legislature were induced to vote in favor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
of the law, which constituted the contract [with the
original grantees], by being promised an interest in
it, and that therefore the act is a mere nullity." A
tribunal "sitting as a court of law" cannot decide,
in a suit between private parties, that the law of a
State "is a nullity in consequence of the impure motives
which influenced certain members of the legislature
which passed the law."<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> Conceding, for the
sake of argument, that "the original transaction was
infected with fraud," the purchasers from the land
companies were innocent according to the records
before the court. Yet, if the rescinding act were
valid, it "annihilated their rights.... The legislature
of Georgia was a party to this transaction; and for a
party to pronounce its own deed invalid" was an
assertion "not often heard in courts of justice." It
was true, as urged, that "the real party ... are the
people"; but they can act only through agents
whose "acts must be considered as the acts of the
people." Should these agents prove unfaithful, the
people can choose others to undo the nefarious work,
"if their contracts be examinable" by legislation.<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a></p>

<p>Admit that the State "might claim to itself the
power of judging in its own case, yet there are certain
great principles of justice ... that ought not to
be entirely disregarded." Thus, at first, Marshall
rested his opinion on elementary "principles of
justice," rather than on the Constitution. These
"principles" required that an innocent purchaser
should not suffer. "If there be any concealed defect,
arising from the conduct of those who had held the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
property long before he acquired it, of which he had
no notice, that concealed defect cannot be set up
against him. He has paid his money for a title good
at law; he is innocent, whatever may be the guilt of
others, and equity will not subject him to the penalties
attached to that guilt. All titles would be insecure,
and the intercourse between man and man
would be very seriously obstructed, if this principle
be overturned." The John Marshall who sat in the
Virginia Legislature<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> is speaking now.</p>

<p>Even if the Legislature could throw aside all "rules
of property," still the rescinding act is "supported
by its power alone, and the same power may divest
any other individual of his lands, if it shall be the
will of the legislature so to exert it." To make this
perfectly clear, Marshall defined the theory relied
upon by the opponents of the Yazoo fraud&mdash;"The
principle is this: that a legislature may, by its own
act, divest the vested estate of any man whatever,
for reasons which shall, by itself, be deemed sufficient."<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a></p>

<p>Supposing that the Georgia sale act had been procured
by fraud; nevertheless, "the grant, when issued,
conveyed an estate in fee-simple to the grantee,
clothed with all the solemnities which law can bestow.
This estate was transferable; and those who
purchased parts of it were not stained by that guilt
which infected the original transaction." They could
not, therefore, be made to suffer for the wrong of
another.</p>

<p>Any legislature can, of course, repeal the acts of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
preceding one, and no legislature can limit the powers
of its successor. "But, if an act be done under a
law, a succeeding legislature cannot undo it. The
past cannot be recalled by the most absolute power."
The purchase of estates from the land companies
was, by virtue of law, "a fact, and cannot cease to be
a fact," even if the State should deny that it was a
fact.</p>

<p>"When, then, a law is in its nature a contract,
where absolute rights have vested under that contract,
a repeal of the law cannot divest those rights."
If it can, such a power is "applicable to the case of
every individual in the community." Regardless of
written constitutions, the "nature of society and
of government" prescribes "limits to the legislative
power." But "where are they to be found, if the
property of an individual, fairly and honestly acquired,
may be seized without compensation?"
Again Marshall founds his reasoning, not on the
Constitution, but on fundamental principles. At
last, however, he arrives at the Constitution.</p>

<p>Georgia was not a single sovereign power, but
"a part of a large empire, ... a member of the American
Union; and that Union has a constitution ...
which imposes limits to the legislatures of the
several states, which none claim a right to pass."
Had the Legislature of Georgia overstepped those
limits? "Is a grant a contract?" The answer to
that depended upon the definition of a contract.
On this decisive point Marshall cited Blackstone:
"A contract executed ... differs in nothing from
a grant." This was the exact case presented by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
the Georgia sale act and the fulfillment, by the
purchasers, of the conditions of it. "A party is,
therefore, always estopped by his own grant," one
obligation of which is that he shall never attempt
"to re-assert that right" thus disposed of.</p>

<p>By this reasoning Marshall finally came to the
conclusion that the Constitution plainly covered the
case. That instrument did not distinguish between
grants by individuals and those by States. If a
State could not pass a law impairing the obligation
of contracts between private persons, neither could
it invalidate a contract made by itself.</p>

<p>Indeed, as everybody knew, said Marshall, "the
framers of the constitution viewed, with some apprehension,
the violent acts which might grow out of
the feelings of the moment; and that the people
of the United States, in adopting that instrument,
have manifested a determination to shield themselves
and their property from the effects of those
sudden and strong passions to which men are exposed."
Therefore, it was provided in America's
fundamental law that "no state shall pass any bill
of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the
obligation of contracts."<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a></p>

<p>Such limitations, declared Marshall, constitute a
bill of rights for the people of each State. Would
any one pretend to say that a State might enact an
<i>ex post facto</i> law or pass a bill of attainder? Certainly
not! How then could anybody pretend that a State
could by legislation annul a contract?</p>

<p>Thus far the opinion of the court was unanimous.<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
As to the Indian title, Justice Johnson dissented.
On the want of power of the Georgia Legislature to
annul the sale act of 1795, the Republican Associate
Justice was, however, even more emphatic than the
soft-spoken Federalist Chief Justice. But he ended
by a rebuke which, if justified, and if the case had
not been so important and the situation so critical,
probably would have required the peremptory dismissal
of the appeal and the disbarment of counsel
appearing in the cause. Justice Johnson intimated&mdash;all
but formally charged&mdash;that the case was
collusive.</p>

<p>"I have been very unwilling," he said, "to proceed
to the decision of this cause at all. It appears
to me to be[ar] strong evidence, upon the face of it,
of being a mere feigned case. It is our duty to decide
upon the rights but not upon the speculations of
parties. My confidence, however, in the respectable
gentlemen who have been engaged for the parties,
had induced me to abandon my scruples, in the belief
that they would never consent to impose a mere
feigned case upon this court."<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a></p>

<p>One cannot patiently read these words. Far
better had Justice William Johnson denounced
Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck for what everybody believed it to
be, and what it really was, or else had refrained from
raising the question, than in these unctuous sentences
to have shifted the responsibility upon the
shoulders of the attorneys who appeared before the
Supreme Bench. The conclusion seems inescapable
that had not Jefferson, who placed Johnson on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
Supreme Bench, and Jefferson's Secretary of State
and political legatee, James Madison, ardently desired
the disposition which Marshall made of the
case, Justice Johnson would have placed on record
a stronger statement of the nature of this litigation.</p>

<p>The fact that Marshall rendered an opinion, under
the circumstances, is one of the firmest proofs of his
greatness. As in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, the supremacy
of the National Judiciary had to be asserted or its
inferiority conceded, so in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck, it was
necessary that the Nation's highest court should
plainly lay down the law of public contract, notify
every State of its place in the American system, and
announce the limitations which the National Constitution
places upon each State.</p>

<p>Failure to do this would have been to sanction
Georgia's rescinding act, to encourage other States
to take similar action, and to render insecure and
litigious numberless titles acquired innocently and
in good faith, and multitudes of contracts entered
into in the belief that they were binding. A weaker
man than John Marshall, and one less wise and courageous,
would have dismissed the appeal or decided
the case on technical points.</p>

<p>Marshall's opinion did more than affect the controversy
in Congress over the Yazoo lands. It announced
fundamental principles for the guidance of
the States and the stabilizing of American business.<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
It increased the confidence in him of the conservative
elements and of all Nationalists. But, for the
same reason, it deepened the public distrust of him
and the popular hostility toward him.</p>

<p>Although Marshall's opinion gave steadiness to
commercial intercourse at a time when it was sadly
needed, checked for the moment a flood of contract-breaking
laws, and asserted the supremacy of Nationalism
over Localism, it also strengthened many
previous speculations that were at least doubtful
and some that were corrupt.<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> Moreover, it furnished
the basis for questionable public grants in the future.
Yet the good effects of it fairly outweighed the bad.
Also it taught the people to be careful in the choice
of their representatives in all legislative bodies; if
citizens will not select honest and able men as their
public agents, they must suffer the consequences of
their indifference to their own affairs.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of other aspects of this
case, it must be conceded that Marshall could not
have disobeyed the plain command of the Constitution
which forbids any State to impair the obligation
of contracts. That the Georgia Legislature was
guilty of such violation even Jefferson's appointee,
Justice Johnson, declared more emphatically than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
did Marshall himself. If Johnson had asserted that
a legislative grant, accepted by the grantee, was not
a contract, Marshall's opinion would have been
fatally wounded.</p>

<p>It had now been Marshall's fate to deliver opinions
in three cases<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> which helped to assure his future
fame, but which, at the moment, were highly unwelcome
to the people. Throughout the country,
at the end of the first decade of the nineteenth century,
a more unpopular person could not have been
found than that wise, brave, gentle man, the Chief
Justice of the United States.</p>

<p>Marshall's opinion and the decision of the court
had no practical effect whatever, so far as the legal
result of it was concerned, but it had some influence
in the settlement of the controversy by Congress.
The Eleventh Congress was in session when
Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck was decided, and the New England
Yazoo claimants immediately presented another petition
for relief. Soon after Marshall's opinion was
published, Randolph moved that the New England
memorial be referred to the Committee of Claims
with instructions to report to the House. The matter,
he said, must not go by default. He wanted
nothing "done, directly or indirectly, by any act of
commission or omission, that should give any the
slightest degree of countenance to that claim."</p>

<p>Randolph thus brought Marshall's opinion before
the House: "A judicial decision, of no small importance,
had, during the present session of Congress,
taken place in relation to that subject." To let the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
business rest, particularly at this time, "would wear
the appearance abroad of acquiescence [by the
House] in that judicial decision." The Yazoo claimants
must not be allowed to profit in this way by
the action of the Supreme Court as they would
surely do if not prevented, since "never has a claim
been pressed upon the public with such pertinacity,
with such art, with such audacity."<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<p>George M. Troup of Georgia, slender, handsome,
fair-haired,<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> then thirty years old and possessing all
the fiery aggressiveness of youth, sprang to his feet
to add his reproof of Marshall and the Supreme
Court. He declared that the opinion of the Chief
Justice, in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck, was a pronouncement
"which the mind of every man attached to Republican
principles must revolt at."<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a></p>

<p>Because the session was closing and from pressure
of business, Randolph withdrew his motion to refer
the memorial to the Committee, and offered another:
"That the prayer of the petition of the New
England Mississippi Land Company is unreasonable,
unjust, and ought not to be granted." This, if
passed, would amount to a condemnation by the
House of the decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States. All Federalists and conservative
Republicans combined to defeat it, and the resolution
was lost by a vote of 46 yeas to 54 nays.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p>But Troup would not yield. On December 17 he
insisted that the National Government should resist
by force of arms the judgment of the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
Court. The title to the lands was in the United
States, he said, yet the court had decided it to be
in the Yazoo claimants. "This decision must either
be acquiesced in or resisted by the United States....
If the Government ... would not submit to
this decision, ... what course could be taken but
to employ the whole military force ... to eject all
persons not claiming under the authority of the
United States?" Should those "in whose behalf"
Marshall's opinion was rendered, take possession,
either the National Government must "remove
them by ... military power, or tamely acquiesce in
the lawless aggression."<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a></p>

<p>But Marshall and the Supreme Court were to be
attacked still more openly and violently. Strengthened
by the decision in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck, the Yazoo
claimants pressed Congress harder than ever for
payment. On January 20, 1813, a bill from the Senate
providing for the payment of the claims came
up for consideration in the House.</p>

<p>Troup instantly took the floor, moved its rejection
and delivered such an excoriation of the Supreme
Court as never before was or has since been
heard in Congress. He began by reciting the details
of the "hideous corruption." Such legislation was
void <i>ab initio</i>. The original speculators had made
fortunes out of the deal, and now Congress was asked
to make the fortunes of the second-hand speculators.
For years the House had, most righteously, repelled
their audacious assaults; but now they had devised
a new weapon of attack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span></p>

<p>They had secured the assistance of the Judiciary.
"Two of the speculators combined and made up a
fictitious case, a feigned issue for the decision of the
Supreme Court," asserted Troup. "They presented
precisely those points for the decision of the Court
which they wished the Court to decide, and the Court
did actually decide them as the speculators themselves
would have decided them if they had been
in the place of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>"The first point was, whether the Legislature of
Georgia had the <i>power</i> to sell the territory.</p>

<p>"Yes, said the Judges, they had.</p>

<p>"Whether by the Yazoo act an estate did vest in
the original grantees?</p>

<p>"Yes, said the Judges, it did.</p>

<p>"Whether it was competent to any subsequent
Legislature to set aside the act on the ground of fraud
and corruption?</p>

<p>"No, said the Judges, it was not.... No matter,
say the Judges, what the nature or extent of the corruption,
... be it ever so nefarious, it could not be
set aside....</p>

<p>"The [legal] maxim that third purchasers without
notice shall not be affected by the fraud of the original
parties" had, declared Troup, been wielded by
the Judges for the benefit of the speculators and to
the ruin of the country.</p>

<p>"Thus, sir, by a maxim of English law are the
rights and liberties of the people of this country to
be corruptly bartered by their Representatives.</p>

<p>"It is this decision of the Judges which has been
made the basis of the bill on your table&mdash;a decision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
shocking to every free Government, sapping the
foundations of all your constitutions, and annihilating
at a breath the best hope of man.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," exclaimed the deeply stirred and sincerely
angered Georgian, "it is proclaimed by the
Judges, and is now to be sanctioned by the Legislature,
that the Representatives of the people may corruptly
betray the people, may corruptly barter their
rights and those of their posterity, and the people are
wholly without any kind of remedy whatsoever.</p>

<p>"It is this monstrous and abhorrent doctrine
which must startle every man in the nation, that you
ought promptly to discountenance and condemn."</p>

<p>In such fashion the enraged Troup ran on; and he
expressed the sentiments of the vast majority of the
inhabitants of the United States. The longer the
Georgia champion of popular justice and the rights of
the States talked, the more unrestrained became his
sentiments and his expression of them: "If, Mr.
Speaker, the arch-fiend had in ... his hatred to mankind
resolved the destruction of republican government
on earth, he would have issued a decree like
that of the judges"&mdash;the opinion of John Marshall
in Fletcher <i>vs.</i> Peck. "Why ... do the judges who
passed this decision live and live unpunished?...
The foundations of the Republic are shaken and the
judges sleep in tranquillity at home.... The question
... had been so often discussed" that it was
"well understood by every man in the nation."
Troup prophesied, therefore, that "no party in this
country, however deeply seated in power, can long
survive the adoption of this measure."<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Federalist-Jeffersonian Yazoo coalition
held firm and Troup's motion to reject the Senate
Yazoo bill was lost by a vote of 55 to 59.<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> The relief
bill was delayed, however, and the claimants were
compelled to nurse their eighteen-year-old disappointment
until another session of Congress convened.</p>

<p>The following year the bill to settle the Yazoo
claims was again introduced in the Senate and passed
by that body without opposition. On February 28,
1814, the measure reached the House.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> On the second
reading of it, Troup despairingly moved that the
bill be rejected. The intrepid and resourceful John
Randolph had been beaten in the preceding Congressional
election, the House no longer echoed with
his fearless voice, and his dominant personality no
longer inspired his followers or terrified his enemies.
Troup could not bend the mighty bow that Randolph
had left behind and that he alone could draw. But
the dauntless Georgian did his best. Once more he
went over the items of this "circle of fraud," as
he branded it. Success of the "plunderers" now depended
on the affirmation by Congress of Marshall's
opinion, which, said Troup, "overturns Republican
Government. You cannot, you dare not, sanctify
this doctrine." If you do so, then "to talk of the
rights of the people after this is insult and mockery."<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a></p>

<p>Long did Troup argue and denounce. He could
not keep his eager fingers from the throat of John
Marshall and the Supreme Court. "The case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
Fletcher and Peck was a decision of a feigned issue,
made up between two speculators, to decide certain
points, in the decision of which they were interested....
Whenever it is conceded that it is competent
to the Supreme Court, in a case between A
and B, to take from the United States fifty [<i>sic</i>]
millions of acres of land, it will be time for the Government
to make a voluntary surrender of the public
property to whosoever will have it.... Sir, I am
tired and disgusted with this subject."<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a></p>

<p>Robert Wright of Maryland urged the passage of
the bill. "He ... dwelt ... on the sanctity of the title
of the present claimants under the decision of the
Supreme Court, against whose awards he hoped
never to see the bayonet employed. He feared not
to advocate this bill on account of the clamor against
it. Let justice be done though the heavens fall."<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a></p>

<p>Weaker and ever weaker grew the assaults of the
opponents against Marshall's opinion and the bill to
reimburse the Yazoo claimants. In every case the
speakers supported or resisted the bill solely according
to the influence of their constituents. Considerations
of local politics, and not devotion to the
Constitution or abhorrence of fraud, moved the Representatives.
The House voted, 56 to 92, against
Troup's motion to reject the bill.<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> Finally the measure
was referred to a select committee, with instructions
to report.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> Almost immediately this committee
reported in favor of the Yazoo claimants.<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> No
time was lost and the friends of the bill now crowded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
the measure to a vote with all the aggressive confidence
of an assured majority. By a vote of 84 yeas to
76 nays, five millions of dollars were appropriated
for reimbursement to the purchasers of the Yazoo
lands.<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a></p>

<p>Daniel Webster, who was serving his first term in
the House and supported the bill, thus describes the
situation at the time of its passage: "The Yazoo bill
is through, passed by eight majority. It excited a
great deal of feeling. All the Federalists supported
the bill, and some of the Democrats. Georgians, and
some Virginians and Carolinians, opposed it with
great heat.... Our feeling was to get the Democratic
support of it."<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a></p>

<p>Thus John Marshall's great opinion was influential
in securing from Congress the settlement of the
claims of numerous innocent investors who had, in
good faith, purchased from a band of legislative corruptionists.
Of infinitely more importance, however,
is the fact that Marshall's words asserted the power
of the Supreme Court of the United States to annul
State laws passed in violation of the National Constitution,
and that throughout the Republic a fundamental
principle of the law of public contract was
established.</p>

These writers leave the unjust inference that Wilson was one of
those who were corrupting the Legislature. This is almost certainly
untrue. For a quarter of a century Wilson had been a heavy speculator
in Indian lands, and it appears reasonable that he took this money
to Augusta for the purpose of investment. When the deal was
consummated, the Justice held shares to the amount of at least three
quarters of a million of acres. (Chappell, 94.)</p></div>

the title. In October, 1795, the treaty with the Spanish Government,

knowledge that the treaty would be negotiated long before it was

which had been at work more than three months before the
"contract clause" was suggested. Even then the proposal was only
as to <i>new</i> States. The motion was made by Rufus King of New York
on August 28. Gouverneur Morris objected. "This would be going
too far," he said. George Mason of Virginia said the same thing. Madison
thought "a negative on the State laws could alone secure the
effect." James Wilson of Pennsylvania warmly supported King's
motion. John Rutledge of South Carolina moved, as a substitute for
King's proposition, that States should not pass "bills of attainder nor
retrospective laws." (<i>Records, Fed. Conv.</i>: Farrand, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 440.) This carried,
and nothing more appears as to the contract clause until it was
included by the Committee on Style in its report of September 12.
(<i>Ib.</i> 596-97.) Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts strongly favored it
and even wanted Congress "to be laid under the like prohibitions."
(<i>Ib.</i> 619.) The Convention refused to insert the word "previous"
before "obligation." (<i>Ib.</i> 636.)
</p><p>
In this manner the provision that "no state shall pass any law impairing
the obligation of contracts" was inserted in the Constitution.
The framers of that instrument apparently had in mind, however, the
danger of the violation of contracts through depreciated paper money
rather than the invalidation of agreements by the direct action of
State Legislatures. (See speech of William R. Davie in the North
Carolina Convention, July 29, 1788, <i>ib.</i> <span class="smcap">iii</span>, 349-50; speech of James
McHenry before the Maryland House of Delegates, Nov. 29, 1787,
<i>ib.</i> 150; and speech of Luther Martin before same, same date, <i>ib.</i> 214;
also see Madison to Ingersoll, Feb. 2, 1831, <i>ib.</i> 495.)
</p><p>
Madison best stated the reason for the adoption of the contract
clause: "A violations [<i>sic</i>] of Contracts had become familiar in the
form of depreciated paper made a legal tender, of property substituted
for money, of Instalment laws, and of the occlusions of the Courts
of Justice; although evident that all such interferences affected the
rights of other States, relatively Creditor, as well as Citizens Creditors
within the State." (<i>Ib.</i> 548.) Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth
explained briefly that the clause "was thought necessary as a security
to commerce." (Letter to the Governor of Connecticut, Sept. 26,
1787, <i>ib.</i> 100.)</p></div>

people to invest also. (See Chappell, 109.)</p></div>

compact form, all the essential documents relating to Georgia's title as
well as the sale and rescinding acts. Other arguments on both sides
appeared. One of the ablest of these was a pamphlet by John E.
Anderson and William J. Hobby, attorneys of Augusta, Georgia, and
published at that place in 1799 "at the instance of the purchasers."
It is entitled: <i>The Contract for the Purchase of the Western Territory
Made with the Legislature of Georgia in the Year 1795, Considered with

Harper said that that question "must be determined in a Court of

himself once had an interest in the purchase, but had disposed of it
three years before when it appeared that the matter must come before
Congress (<i>Annals</i>, 5th Cong. 2d Sess. 1277-78); the debate occupied
parts of two days (see also <i>ib.</i> 1298-1313). In view of the heated

<p>Applications from different persons suffering prosecution
under the act usually called the Sedition act, claimed my early
attention to that instrument. our country has thought proper
to distribute the powers of it's government among three equal
&amp; independent authorities, constituting each a check on one
or both of the others, in all attempts to impair it's constitution.
to make each an effectual check, it must have a right in cases
which arise within the line of it's proper functions, where,
equally with the others, it acts in the last resort &amp; without
appeal, to decide on the validity of an act according to it's own
judgment, &amp; uncontrouled by the opinions of any other department.
we have accordingly, in more than one instance, seen
the opinions of different departments in opposition to each
other, &amp; no ill ensue. the constitution moreover, as a further
security for itself, against violation even by a concurrence of
all the departments, has provided for it's own reintegration
by a change of the persons exercising the functions of those
department. Succeeding functionaries have the same right to
judge of the conformity or non-conformity of an act with the
constitution, as their predecessors who past it. for if it be
against that instrument it is a perpetual nullity. uniform decisions
indeed, sanctioned by successive functionaries, by the
public voice, and by repeated elections would so strengthen a
construction as to render highly responsible a departure from
it. On my accession to the administration, reclamations against
the Sedition act were laid before me by individual citizens,
claiming the protection of the constitution against the Sedition
act. called on by the position in which the nation had placed
me, to exercise in their behalf my free &amp; independent judgment,
I took the act into consideration, compared it with the constitution,
viewed it under every aspect of which I thought it susceptible,
and gave to it all the attention which the magnitude
of the case demanded. on mature deliberation, in the presence
of the nation, and under the tie of the solemn oath which binds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
me to them &amp; to my duty, I do declare that I hold that act to be
in palpable &amp; unqualified contradiction to the constitution.
considering it then as a nullity, I have relieved from oppression
under it those of my fellow-citizens who were within the reach
of the functions confided to me. in recalling our footsteps
within the limits of the Constitution, I have been actuated by
a zealous devotion to that instrument. it is the ligament which
binds us into one nation. It is, to the national government, the
law of it's existence, with which it began, and with which it is
to end. infractions of it may sometimes be committed from
inadvertence, sometimes from the panic, or passions of a moment.
to correct these with good faith, as soon as discovered,
will be an assurance to the states that, far from meaning to
impair that sacred charter of it's authorities, the General
government views it as the principle of it's own life.<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Virginia&mdash;Caroline</span>&mdash;Dec<sup>r</sup> 22<sup>d&#803;</sup> 1801<br />
</p>
<p class="noidt">
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span><br />
</p>

<p>An absence from home, when your letter arrived, has been
the cause which delayed this answer.</p>

<p>I confess that I have not abstracted myself from the political
world, but I must at the same time acknowledge, that this kind
of world, of which I am a member, is quite distinct from that
in which your country has placed you. Mine is a sort of metaphysical
world, over which the plastick power of the imagination
is unlimited&mdash;yours, being only physical, cannot be
modulated by fancy. The ways of mine are smooth &amp; soft;
of yours, rugged &amp; thorny. And a most prosperous traveller
into the political world which I inhabit, generally becomes
unfortunate if he wanders into the region of which you are
now a resident. Yet, as a solicitation for the continuance of
your correspondence, I will venture upon a short excursion
out of my own atmosphere, in relation to the subject you
state.</p>

<p>By way of bringing the point into plain view, I will suppose
some cases. Suppose a congress and president should conspire
to erect five times as many courts &amp; judges, as were made by
the last law, meerely for the sake of giving salaries to themselves
or their friends, and should annex to each office, a salary of
100,000 dollars. Or suppose a president in order to reward his
counsel on an impeachment, and the members of the senate who
voted for his acquittal, had used his influence with the legislature
to erect useless tribunals, paid by him in fees or bribes.
Or, lastly, suppose a long list of courts and judges to be established,
without any ill intention, but meerly from want of intellect
in the legislature, which from experience are found to be
useless, expensive and unpopular. Are all these evils originating
either in fraud or error, remediless under the principles of
your constitution?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span></p>

<p>The first question is, whether the <i>office</i> thus established, is
to continue.</p>

<p>The second, whether the officer is to continue, after the office
is abolished, as being unnecessary.</p>

<p>Congress are empowered "from <i>time to time</i> to ordain &amp; establish
inferior courts."</p>

<p>The law for establishing the present inferior courts, is a legislative
construction, affirming that under this clause, congress
may <i>abolish</i> as well as create these <i>judicial offices</i>; because it
does expressly <i>abolish</i> the then existing inferior courts, for the
purpose of making way for the present.</p>

<p>It is probable that this construction is correct, but it is
equally pertinent to our object, whether it is or not. If it is,
then the present inferior courts may be abolished, as constitutionally
as the last; if it is not, then the law for abolishing the
former courts, and establishing the present, was unconstitutional,
and being so, is undoubtedly repealable.</p>

<p>Thus the only ground which the present inferior courts can
take, is, that congress may from time to time, regulate, create
or abolish such courts, as the public interest may dictate, because
such is the very tenure under which they exist.</p>

<p>The second question is, whether the officer is to continue
after the office is abolished, as being useless or pernicious.</p>

<p>The constitution declares "that the judge shall hold his <i>office</i>
during good behavior." Could it mean, that he should hold this
<i>office</i> after it was <i>abolished</i>? Could it mean that his tenure
should be limited by behaving well in an office, which did not
exist?</p>

<p>It must either have intended these absurdities, or admit of a
construction which will avoid them. This construction obviously
is, that the officer should hold that which he might hold,
namely, an existing office, so long as he did that which he might
do, namely, his duty in that office; and not that he should hold
an office, which did not exist, or perform duties not sanctioned
by law. If therefore congress can abolish the courts, as they
did by the last law, the officer dies with his office, unless you
allow the constitution to intend impossibilities as well as
absurdities. A construction bottomed upon either, overthrows
the benefits of language and intellect.</p>

<p>The article of the constitution under consideration closes
with an idea, which strongly supports my construction.</p>

<p>The salary is to be paid "during their continuance in office."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
This limitation of salary is perfectly clear and distinct. It literally
excludes the idea of paying a salary, when the officer is not
in office; and it is undeniably certain, that he cannot be in
office, when there is no office. There must have been some other
mode by which the officer should cease to be in office, than
that of <i>bad behaviour</i>, because, if this had not been the case, the
constitution would have directed "that the judges should hold
their offices <i>and salaries</i> during good behaviour," instead of
directing "that they should" hold the salaries during <i>their
continuance</i> in office. This could only be an abolition of the
office itself, by which the salary would cease with the office,
tho' the judge might have conducted himself unexceptionably.</p>

<p>This construction certainly coincides with the public opinion,
and the principles of the constitution. By neither is the idea for
a moment tolerated, of maintaining burthensome sinecure
offices, to enrich unfruitful individuals.</p>

<p>Nor is it incompatible with the "good behaviour" tenure,
when its origin is considered. It was invented in England, to
counteract the influence of the crown over the judges, and we
have rushed into the principle with such precipitancy, in imitation
of this our general prototype, as to have outstript monarchists,
in our efforts to establish a judicial oligarchy; their judges
being removable by a joint vote of Lords &amp; commons, and ours
by no similar or easy process.</p>

<p>The tenure however is evidently bottomed upon the idea of
securing the honesty of Judges, whilst exercising the office, and
not upon that of sustaining useless or pernicious offices, for the
sake of Judges. The regulation of offices in England, and indeed
of inferior offices in most or all countries, depends upon the
legislature; it is a part of the detail of the government, which
necessarily devolves upon it, and is beyond the foresight of
a constitution, because it depends on variable circumstances.
And in England, a regulation of the courts of justice, was never
supposed to be a violation of the "good behaviour" tenure.</p>

<p>If this principle should disable congress from erecting tribunals
which temporary circumstances might require, without
entailing them upon the society after these circumstances by
ceasing, had converted them in grievances, it would be used in
a mode, contemplated neither in its original or duplicate.</p>

<p>Whether courts are erected by regard to the administration
of justice, or with the purpose of rewarding a meritorious faction,
the legislature may certainly abolish them without in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>fringing
the constitution, whenever they are not required by
the administration of justice, or the merit of the faction is
exploded, and their claim to reward disallowed.</p>

<p>With respect to going into the judiciary system farther at
present, the length of this trespass forbids it, and perhaps all
ideas tending towards the revision of our constitution would
be superfluous, as I fear it is an object not now to be attained.
All my hopes upon this question rest I confess with Mr: Jefferson,
and yet I know not how far he leans towards the revision.
But he will see &amp; the people will feel, that his administration
bears a distinct character, from that of his predecessor, and of
course discover this shocking truth, that the nature of our
government depends upon the complection of the president,
and not upon the principles of the constitution. He will not
leave historians to say "this was a good president, but like a
good Roman Emperor he left the principles of the government
unreformed, so that his country remained exposed to eternal
repetitions of those oppressions after his death, which he had
himself felt and healed during his life."</p>

<p>And yet my hopes are abated by some essays signed "Solon"
published at Washington, and recommending amendments to
the constitution. They are elegantly written, but meerly skim
along the surface of the subject, without touching a radical
idea. They seem to be suggested by the pernicious opinion,
that the administration only has been chargeable with the
defectiveness of our operating government heretofore. Who is
the author of these pieces?</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed our exultation on account of the president's
message, and the countenance of congress&mdash;nothing
can exceed the depression of the monarchists. They deprecate
political happiness&mdash;we hope for the president's aid to place
it on a rock before he dies.</p>

<p>It would have given me great pleasure to have seen you here,
and I hope it may be still convenient for you to call. I close
with your proposal to correspond, if the political wanderings
of a man, almost in a state of vegitation, will be accepted for
that interesting detail of real affairs, with which you propose
occasionally to treat me. I am, with great regard, Dr Sir</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cases of which Chief Justice Marshall may have heard
before he delivered his Opinion in Marbury</span> <i>vs.</i>
<span class="smcap">Madison</span>.<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> <span class="smcap">Also Recent Books and Articles on the
Doctrine of Judicial Review of Legislation</span></h3>


<p>Holmes <i>vs.</i> Walton (November, 1779, New Jersey), before
Chief Justice David Brearly. (See Austin Scott in American
<i>Historical Review</i>, <span class="smcap">iv</span>, 456 <i>et seq.</i>) If Marshall ever heard of
this case, it was only because Paterson, who was Associate
Justice with Marshall when the Supreme Court decided
Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison, was attorney-general in New Jersey at
the time Holmes <i>vs.</i> Walton was decided. Both Brearly and
William Paterson were members of the Constitutional Convention
of 1787. (See Corwin, footnote to 41-42.)</p>

<p>Commonwealth <i>vs.</i> Caton (November, 1782, 4 Call, 5-21), a
noted Virginia case. (See Tyler, I, 174-75.) The language of the
court in this case is merely <i>obiter dicta</i>; but George Wythe
and John Blair were on the Bench, and both of them were afterwards
members of the Constitutional Convention. Blair was
appointed by President Washington as one of the Associate
Justices of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>As to the much-talked-of Rhode Island case of Trevett <i>vs.</i>
Weeden (September, 1786; see Arnold: <i>History of Rhode Island</i>,
<span class="smcap">ii</span>, 525-27, Varnum's pamphlet, <i>Case of Trevett vs. Weeden</i>, and
Chandler's <i>Criminal Trials</i>, <span class="smcap">ii</span>, 269-350), it is improbable
that Marshall had any knowledge whatever of it. It arose in
1786 when the country was in chaos; no account of it appeared
in the few newspapers that reached Virginia, and Varnum's
description of the incident&mdash;for it can hardly be called a case&mdash;could
scarcely have had any circulation outside of New
England. It was referred to in the Constitutional Convention
at Philadelphia in 1787, but the journals of that convention
were kept secret until many years after Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison
was decided.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the recently discussed case of Bayard <i>vs.</i>
Singleton (North Carolina, November, 1787, 1 Martin, 48-51),
ever reached Marshall's attention except by hearsay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span></p>

<p>The second Hayburn case (August, 1792, 2 Dallas, 409; and
see <i>Annals</i>, 2d Cong. 2d Sess. 1319-22). For a full discussion of
this important case see particularly Professor Max Farrand's
analysis in the <i>American Historical Review</i> (<span class="smcap">xiii</span>, 283-84), which
is the only satisfactory treatment of it. See also Thayer: <i>Cases
on Constitutional Law</i> (1, footnote to 105).</p>

<p>Kamper <i>vs.</i> Hawkins (November, 1793, 1 Va. Ca. 20 <i>et seq.</i>),
a case which came directly under Marshall's observation.</p>

<p>Van Horne's Lessee <i>vs.</i> Dorrance (April, 1795, 2 Dallas, 304),
in which Justice Paterson of the Supreme Court said all that
Marshall repeated in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison upon the power
of the Judiciary to declare legislation void.</p>

<p>Calder <i>vs.</i> Bull (August, 1798, 3 Dallas, 386-401), in which,
however, the Court questioned its power to annul legislation.
Cooper <i>vs.</i> Telfair (February, 1800, 4 Dallas, 14). These last
two cases and the Hayburn Case had been decided by justices
of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Whittington <i>vs.</i> Polk (Maryland, April, 1802, 1 Harris and
Johnson, 236-52). Marshall surely was informed of this case
by Chase who, as Chief Justice of Maryland, decided it. The
report, however, was not published until 1821. (See McLaughlin:
<i>The Courts, the Constitution, and Parties</i>, 20-23.) In his
opinion in this case Justice Chase employed precisely the same
reasoning used by Marshall in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison to show
the power of courts to declare invalid legislative acts that violate
the Constitution.</p>

<p>The old Court of Appeals, under the Articles of Confederation,
denounced as unconstitutional the law that assigned circuit
duties to the judges of that appellate tribunal; and this
was cited by Thomas Morris of New York and by John Stanley
of South Carolina in the judiciary debate of 1802.<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a></p>

<p>As to the statement of Chief Justice, later Governor Thomas
Hutchinson of Massachusetts, in 1765, and the ancient British
precedents, cited by Robert Ludlow Fowler in the <i>American
Law Review</i> (<span class="smcap">xxix</span>, 711-25), it is positive that Marshall never
had an intimation that any such pronouncements ever had been
made.</p>

<p>Neither, in all likelihood, had Marshall known of the highly
advertised case of Rutgers <i>vs.</i> Waddington, decided by a New
York justice of the peace in 1784 (see <i>American Law Review</i>,
<span class="smcap">xix</span>, 180), and the case of Bowman <i>vs.</i> Middleton (South Caro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>lina,
May, 1792, 1 Bay, 252-55) which was not printed until
1809. (See McLaughlin, 25-26.) The same may be said of the
North Carolina controversy, State <i>vs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;, decided in April,
1794 (1 Haywood, 28-40), and of Lindsay <i>et al vs.</i> Commissioners
(South Carolina, October, 1796, 2 Bay, 38-62), the report
of which was not printed until 1811.</p>

<p>For a scholarly treatment of the matter from an historical
and legally professional point of view, see <i>Doctrine of Judicial
Review</i> by Professor Edward S. Corwin of the Department of
History and Politics, Princeton University; also <i>The Courts, the
Constitution, and Parties</i>, by Professor Andrew C. McLaughlin
of the Department of History, University of Chicago. The
discussion by these scholars is thorough. All cases are critically
examined, and they omit only the political exigency that
forced Marshall's opinion in Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison.</p>

<p>The student should also consult the paper of William M.
Meigs, "The Relation of the Judiciary to the Constitution,"
in the <i>American Law Review</i> (<span class="smcap">xix</span>, 175-203), and that of Frank
E. Melvin, "The Judicial Bulwark of the Constitution," in the
<i>American Political Science Review</i> (<span class="smcap">viii</span>, 167-203).</p>

<p>Professor Charles A. Beard's <i>The Supreme Court and the Constitution</i>
contains trustworthy information not readily accessible
elsewhere, as well as sound comment upon the whole subject.</p>

<p><i>Judicial Power and Unconstitutional Legislation</i>, by Brinton
Coxe, although published in 1893, is still highly valuable. And
<i>Power of Federal Judiciary over Legislation</i>, by J. Hampden
Dougherty, will be profitable to the student.</p>

<p>Marbury <i>vs.</i> Madison is attacked ably, if petulantly, by
Dean Trickett, "Judicial Nullification of Acts of Congress,"
in the <i>North American Review</i> (<span class="smcap">clxxxv</span>, 848 <i>et seq.</i>), and also
by James B. McDonough, "The Alleged Usurpation of Power
by the Federal Courts," in the <i>American Law Review</i> (<span class="smcap">xlvi</span>,
45-59). An ingenious and comparatively recent dissent from
the theory of judicial supervision of legislation is the argument
of Chief Justice Walter Clark of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina, "Government by Judges." (See Senate Document
No. 610, 63d Congress, 2d Session.)</p>

<p>With regard to the possible effect on American law of foreign
assertions of the supremacy of the Judiciary, particularly that
of France, the Address of James M. Beck of the New York Bar,
before the Pennsylvania Bar Association on June 29, 1915, and
reported in the Twenty-first Annual Report of that Association
(222-51), is a careful and exhaustive study.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Text, as generally accepted, of the Cipher Letter of
Aaron Burr to James Wilkinson, dated July 29, 1806</span><a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a></h3>


<p>Your letter postmarked thirteenth May, is received. At
length I have obtained funds, and have actually commenced.
The Eastern detachments, from different points and under
different pretences, will rendezvous on the Ohio first of November.
Everything internal and external favors our views. Naval
protection of England is secured. Truxtun is going to Jamaica
to arrange with the admiral on that station. It will meet us
at the Mississippi. England, a navy of the United States, are
ready to join, and final orders are given to my friends and followers.
It will be a host of choice spirits. Wilkinson shall be
second to Burr only; Wilkinson shall dictate the rank and promotion
of his officers. Burr will proceed westward first August,
never to return. With him goes his daughter; her husband will
follow in October, with a corps of worthies. Send forthwith an
intelligent and confidential friend with whom Burr may confer;
he shall return immediately with further interesting details;
this is essential to concert and harmony of movement. Send a
list of all persons known to Wilkinson west of the mountains
who could be useful, with a note delineating their characters.
By your messenger send me four or five commissions of your
officers, which you can borrow under any pretence you please;
they shall be returned faithfully. Already are orders given to
the contractor to forward six months' provisions to points
Wilkinson may name; this shall not be used until the last moment,
and then under proper injunctions. Our object, my dear
friend, is brought to a point so long desired. Burr guarantees
the result with his life and honor, with the lives and honor and
the fortunes of hundreds, the best blood of our country. Burr's
plan of operation is to move down rapidly from the Falls, on
the fifteenth of November, with the first five hundred or a
thousand men, in light boats now constructing for that purpose;
to be at Natchez between the fifth and fifteenth of December,
there to meet you; there to determine whether it will be expedient
in the first instance to seize on or pass by Baton Rouge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
On receipt of this send Burr an answer. Draw on Burr for all
expenses, etc. The people of the country to which we are going
are prepared to receive us; their agents, now with Burr, say
that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject them
to a foreign Power, that in three weeks all will be settled. The
gods invite us to glory and fortune; it remains to be seen whether
we deserve the boon. The bearer of this goes express to you.
He is a man of inviolable honor and perfect discretion, formed
to execute rather than project, capable of relating facts with
fidelity, and incapable of relating them otherwise; he is thoroughly
informed of the plans and intentions of Burr, and will
disclose to you as far as you require, and no further. He has
imbibed a reverence for your character, and may be embarrassed
in your presence; put him at ease, and he will satisfy
you.</p>

of Aaron Burr</span><a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a></h3>


<p>Who is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of letters,
fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in ours.
His history shows that war is not the natural element of his
mind. If it had been, he never would have exchanged Ireland
for America. So far is an army from furnishing the society
natural and proper to Mr. Blennerhassett's character, that on
his arrival in America, he retired even from the population of
the Atlantic States, and sought quiet and solitude in the bosom
of our Western forests.</p>

<p>But he carried with him taste and science and wealth; and
lo, the desert smiled! Possessing himself of a beautiful island
in the Ohio, he rears upon it a palace and decorates it with every
romantic embellishment of fancy. A shrubbery, that Shenstone
might have envied, blooms around him. Music, that might
have charmed Calypso and her nymphs, is his. An extensive
library spreads its treasures before him. A philosophical apparatus
offers to him all the secrets and mysteries of nature.
Peace, tranquillity, and innocence shed their mingled delights
around him. And to crown the enchantment of the scene, a
wife, who is said to be lovely even beyond her sex and graced
with every accomplishment that can render it irresistible, had
blessed him with her love and made him the father of several
children. The evidence would convince you, that this is but
a faint picture of the real life.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this peace, this innocent simplicity and
this tranquillity, this feast of the mind, this pure banquet of
the heart, the destroyer comes; he comes to change this
paradise into a hell. Yet the flowers do not wither at his approach.
No monitory shuddering through the bosom of their
unfortunate possessor warns him of the ruin that is coming upon
him. A stranger presents himself. Introduced to their civilities
by the high rank which he had lately held in his country, he
soon finds his way to their hearts, by the dignity and elegance
of his demeanor, the light and beauty of his conversation and
the seductive and fascinating power of his address.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span></p>

<p>The conquest was not difficult. Innocence is ever simple and
credulous. Conscious of no design itself, it suspects none in
others. It wears no guard before its breast. Every door and
portal and avenue of the heart is thrown open, and all who
choose it enter. Such was the state of Eden when the serpent
entered its bowers.</p>

<p>The prisoner, in a more engaging form, winding himself into
the open and unpractised heart of the unfortunate Blennerhassett,
found but little difficulty in changing the native character
of that heart and the objects of its affection. By degrees
he infuses into it the poison of his own ambition. He breathes
into it the fire of his own courage; a daring and desperate thirst
for glory; an ardour panting for great enterprises, for all the
storm and bustle and hurricane of life.</p>

<p>In a short time the whole man is changed, and every object
of his former delight is relinquished. No more he enjoys the
tranquil scene; it has become flat and insipid to his taste. His
books are abandoned. His retort and crucible are thrown aside.
His shrubbery blooms and breathes its fragrance upon the air
in vain; he likes it not. His ear no longer drinks the rich melody
of music; it longs for the trumpet's clangor and the cannon's
roar. Even the prattle of his babes, once so sweet, no longer
affects him; and the angel smile of his wife, which hitherto
touched his bosom with ecstasy so unspeakable, is now unseen
and unfelt.</p>

<p>Greater objects have taken possession of his soul. His imagination
has been dazzled by visions of diadems, of stars and
garters and titles of nobility. He has been taught to burn with
restless emulation at the names of great heroes and conquerors.
His enchanted island is destined soon to relapse into a wilderness;
and in a few months we find the beautiful and tender
partner of his bosom, whom he lately permitted not the winds
of summer to visit too roughly, we find her shivering at midnight,
on the winter banks of the Ohio and mingling her tears
with the torrents, that froze as they fell.</p>

<p>Yet this unfortunate man, thus deluded from his interest
and his happiness, thus seduced from the paths of innocence
and peace, thus confounded in the toils that were deliberately
spread for him and overwhelmed by the mastering spirit and
genius of another&mdash;this man, thus ruined and undone and
made to play a subordinate part in this grand drama of guilt
and treason, this man is to be called the principal offender,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
while he, by whom he was thus plunged in misery, is comparatively
innocent, a mere accessory! Is this reason? Is it law?
Is it humanity? Sir, neither the human heart nor the human understanding
will bear a perversion so monstrous and absurd!
So shocking to the soul! So revolting to reason! Let Aaron Burr
then not shrink from the high destination which he has courted,
and having already ruined Blennerhassett in fortune, character
and happiness forever, let him not attempt to finish the tragedy
by thrusting that ill-fated man between himself and punishment.<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Essential Part of Marshall's Opinion on Constructive
Treason delivered at the Trial of Aaron Burr, on
Monday, August 31, 1807</span><a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a></h3>


<p>The place in which a crime was committed is essential to an indictment,
were it only to shew the jurisdiction of the court. It
is also essential for the purpose of enabling the prisoner to make
his defence.... This necessity is rendered the stronger by the
constitutional provision that the offender "shall be tried in
the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed,"
and by the act of congress which requires that
twelve petty jurors at least shall be summoned from the county
where the offence was committed.</p>

<p>A description of the particular manner in which the war was
levied seems also essential to enable the accused to make his
defence. The law does not expect a man to be prepared to defend
every act of his life which may be suddenly and without
notice alleged against him. In common justice the particular
fact with which he is charged ought to be stated, and stated in
such a manner as to afford a reasonable certainty of the nature
of the accusation and the circumstances which will be adduced
against him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Treason can only be established by the proof of overt acts;
and ... those overt acts only which are changed in the indictment
can be given in evidence, unless perhaps as corroborative
testimony after the overt acts are proved. That clause in the
constitution too which says that in all criminal prosecutions
the accused shall enjoy the right "to be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation" is considered as having a direct
bearing on this point. It secures to him such information as
will enable him to prepare for his defence.</p>

<p>It seems then to be perfectly clear that it would not be sufficient
for an indictment to allege generally that the accused had
levied war against the United States. The charge must be more
particularly specified by laying what is termed an overt act of
levying war....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span></p>

<p>If it be necessary to specify the charge in the indictment,
it would seem to follow, irresistibly, that the charge must be
proved as laid.... Might it be otherwise, the charge of an overt
act would be a mischief instead of an advantage to the accused.
It would lead him from the true cause and nature of the accusation
instead of informing him respecting it.</p>

<p>But it is contended on the part of the prosecution that, although
the accused had never been with the party which assembled
at Blennerhassett's island, and was, at the time, at a
great distance, and in a different state, he was yet legally present,
and therefore may properly be charged in the indictment as
being present in fact.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary to inquire whether in this case the
doctrine of constructive presence can apply.</p>

<p>It is conceived by the court to be possible that a person may
be concerned in a treasonable conspiracy and yet be legally, as
well as actually absent while some one act of the treason is
perpetrated. If a rebellion should be so extensive as to spread
through every state in the union, it will scarcely be contended
that every individual concerned in it is legally present at every
overt act committed in the course of that rebellion. It would be
a very violent presumption indeed, ... to presume that even
the chief of the rebel army was legally present at every such
overt act.</p>

<p>If the main rebel army, with the chief at its head, should be
prosecuting war at one extremity of our territory, say in New-Hampshire&mdash;if
this chief should be there captured and sent to
the other extremity for the purpose of trial&mdash;if his indictment
instead of alleging an overt act, which was true in point of
fact, should allege that he had assembled some small party,
which in truth he had not seen, and had levied war by engaging
in a skirmish in Georgia at a time when in reality he was fighting
a battle in New-Hampshire&mdash;if such evidence would support
such an indictment by the fiction that he was legally present
though really absent, all would ask to what purpose are
those provisions in the constitution, which direct the place of
trial and ordain that the accused shall be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation?</p>

<p>But that a man may be legally absent, who has counselled or
procured a treasonable act, is proved by all those books which
treat upon the subject; and which concur in declaring that
such a person is a principal traitor, not because he was legally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
present, but because in treason all are principals. Yet the indictment,
speaking upon general principles, would charge him
according to the truth of the case....</p>

<p>If the conspirator had done nothing which amounted to levying
of war, and if by our constitution the doctrine that an accessory
becomes a principal be not adopted, in consequence of
which the conspirator could not be condemned under an indictment
stating the truth of the case, it would be going very
far to say that this defect, if it be termed one, may be cured by
an indictment stating the case untruly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In point of law then, the man, who incites, aids, or procures
a treasonable act, is not merely in consequence of that incitement,
aid or procurement, legally present when that act is committed.</p>

<p>If it do not result, from the nature of the crime, that all who
are concerned in it are legally present at every overt act, then
each case depends upon its own circumstances; and to judge
how far the circumstances of any case can make him legally
present, who is in fact absent, the doctrine of constructive presence
must be examined.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The whole treason laid in this indictment is the levying of
war in Blennerhassett's island; and the whole question to which
the inquiry of the court is now directed is whether the prisoner
was legally present at that fact.</p>

<p>I say this is the whole question; because the prisoner can only
be convicted on the overt act laid in the indictment. With respect
to this prosecution, it is as if no other overt act existed.</p>

<p>If other overt acts can be inquired into, it is for the sole purpose
of proving the particular fact charged. It is as evidence of
the crime consisting of this particular fact, not as establishing
the general crime by a distinct fact.</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution have charged those engaged
in the defence with considering the overt act as the treason,
whereas it ought to be considered solely as the evidence of the
treason; but the counsel for the prosecution seem themselves
not to have sufficiently adverted to this clear principle; that
though the overt act may not be itself the treason, it is the sole
act of that treason which can produce conviction. It is the sole
point in issue between the parties. And the only division of
that point, if the expression be allowed, which the court is now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
examining, is the constructive presence of the prisoner at the
fact charged....</p>

<p>Had the prisoner set out with the party from Beaver for
Blennerhassett's island, or perhaps had he set out for that
place, though not from Beaver, and had arrived in the island, he
would have been present at the fact. Had he not arrived in the
island, but had taken a position near enough to co&ouml;perate with
those on the island, to assist them in any act of hostility, or to
aid them if attacked, the question whether he was constructively
present would be a question compounded of law and
fact, which would be decided by the jury, with the aid of the
court, so far as respected the law. In this case the accused would
have been of the particular party assembled on the island, and
would have been associated with them in the particular act of
levying war said to have been committed on the island.</p>

<p>But if he was not with the party at any time before they
reached the island&mdash;if he did not join them there, or intend to
join them there&mdash;if his personal co&ouml;peration in the general
plan was to be afforded elsewhere, at a great distance, in a different
state&mdash;if the overt acts of treason to be performed by him
were to be distinct overt acts&mdash;then he was not of the particular
party assembled at Blennerhassett's island, and was not constructively
present, aiding and assisting in the particular act
which was there committed.</p>

<p>The testimony on this point, so far as it has been delivered,
is not equivocal. There is not only no evidence that the accused
was of the particular party which assembled on Blennerhassett's
island; but the whole evidence shows he was not of that
party.</p>

<p>In felony then, admitting the crime to have been completed
on the island, and to have been advised, procured, or commanded
by the accused, he would have been incontestably an
accessory and not a principal.</p>

<p>But in treason, it is said, the law is otherwise, because the
theatre of action is more extensive.</p>

<p>The reasoning applies in England as strongly as in the United
States. While in '15 and '45 the family of Stuart sought to regain
the crown they had forfeited, the struggle was for the
whole kingdom; yet no man was ever considered as legally present
at one place, when actually at another; or as aiding in one
transaction, while actually employed in another.</p>

<p>With the perfect knowledge that the whole nation may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
the theatre of action, the English books unite in declaring that
he, who counsels, procures or aids treason, is guilty accessorially
and solely in virtue of the common law principle, that what
will make a man an accessory in felony makes him a principal
in treason. So far from considering a man as constructively
present at every overt act of the general treason in which he
may have been concerned, the whole doctrine of the books
limits the proof against him to those particular overt acts of
levying war with which he is charged.</p>

<p>What would be the effect of a different doctrine? Clearly
that which has been stated. If a person levying war in Kentucky,
may be said to be constructively present and assembled
with a party carrying on war in Virginia at a great distance from
him, then he is present at every overt act performed anywhere.
He may be tried in any state on the continent, where any overt
act has been committed. He may be proved to be guilty of
an overt act laid in the indictment in which he had no personal
participation, by proving that he advised it, or that he
committed other acts.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, too extravagant to be in terms maintained.
Certainly it cannot be supported by the doctrines of the English
law.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In conformity with principle and with authority then, the
prisoner at the bar was neither legally nor actually present at
Blennerhassett's island; and the court is strongly inclined to
the opinion that without proving an actual or legal presence
by two witnesses, the overt act laid in this indictment cannot
be proved.</p>

<p>But this opinion is controverted on two grounds.</p>

<p>The first is, that the indictment does not charge the prisoner
to have been present.</p>

<p>The second, that although he was absent, yet if he caused the
assemblage, he may be indicted as being present, and convicted
on evidence that he caused the treasonable act.</p>

<p>The first position is to be decided by the indictment itself....
The court understands it to be directly charged that the prisoner
did assemble with the multitude and did march with them....
The charges of this special indictment therefore must be
proved as laid, and no evidence which proves the crime in a
form substantially different can be received....</p>

<p>But suppose the law to be as is contended by the counsel for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
the United States. Suppose an indictment, charging an individual
with personally assembling among others and thus levying
war, may be satisfied with the proof that he caused the assemblage.
What effect will this law have upon this case?</p>

<p>The guilt of the accused, if there be any guilt, does not consist
in the assemblage; for he was not a member of it. The
simple fact of assemblage no more affects one absent man than
another.</p>

<p>His guilt then consists in procuring the assemblage, and upon
this fact depends his criminality. The proof relative to the character
of an assemblage must be the same whether a man be present
or absent. In general, to charge any individual with the
guilt of an assemblage, the fact of his presence must be proved:
it constitutes an essential part of the overt act.</p>

<p>If then the procurement be substituted in the place of presence,
does it not also constitute an essential part of the overt
act? must it not also be proved? must it not be proved in the
same manner that presence must be proved?</p>

<p>If in one case the presence of the individual make the guilt of
the assemblage his guilt, and in the other case the procurement
by the individual make the guilt of the assemblage his guilt,
then presence and procurement are equally component parts of
the overt act, and equally require two witnesses.</p>

<p>Collateral points may, say the books, be proved according to
the course of the common law; but is this a collateral point? Is
the fact, without which the accused does not participate in the
guilt of the assemblage if it were guilty, a collateral point? This
cannot be.</p>

<p>The presence of the party, where presence is necessary, being
a part of the overt act must be positively proved by two witnesses.
No presumptive evidence, no facts from which presence
may be conjectured or inferred will satisfy the constitution and
the law.</p>

<p>If procurement take the place of presence and become part of
the overt act, then no presumptive evidence, no facts from
which the procurement may be connected or inferred, can satisfy
the constitution and the law.</p>

<p>The mind is not to be led to the conclusion that the individual
was present by a train of conjectures, of inferences or of
reasoning; the fact must be proved by two witnesses.</p>

<p>Neither, where procurement supplies the want of presence, is
the mind to be conducted to the conclusion that the accused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
procured the assembly, by a train of conjectures of inferences or
of reasoning; the fact itself must be proved by two witnesses,
and must have been committed within the district.</p>

<p>If it be said that the advising or procurement of treason is a
secret transaction, which can scarcely ever be proved in the
manner required by this opinion, the answer which will readily
suggest itself is, that the difficulty of proving a fact will not
justify conviction without proof. Certainly it will not justify
conviction without a direct and positive witness in a case where
the constitution requires two.</p>

<p>The more correct inference from this circumstance would
seem to be, that the advising of the fact is not within the constitutional
definition of the crime. To advise or procure a treason
is in the nature of conspiring or plotting treason, which is
not treason in itself....</p>

<p>The 8th amendment to the constitution has been pressed with
great force.... The accused cannot be said to be "informed of
the nature and cause of the accusation" unless the indictment
give him that notice which may reasonably suggest to him the
point on which the accusations turns [<i>sic</i>], so that he may know
the course to be pursued in his defence.</p>

<p>It is also well worthy of consideration that this doctrine, so
far as it respects treason, is entirely supported by the operation
of the common law, which is said to convert the accessory before
the fact into the principal, and to make the act of the principal
his act. The accessory before the fact is not said to have
levied war. He is not said to be guilty under the statute, but
the common law attaches to him the guilt of that fact which he
has advised or procured; and, as contended, makes it his act.</p>

<p>This is the operation of the common law not the operation of
the statute. It is an operation then which can only be performed
where the common law exists to perform: it is the creature of the
common law, and the creature presupposes its creator. To decide
then that this doctrine is applicable to the United States
would seem to imply the decision that the United States, as a
nation, have a common law which creates and defines the punishment
of crimes accessorial in their nature. It would imply
the further decision that these accessorial crimes are not in the
case of treason excluded by the definition of treason given in
the constitution....</p>

<p>I have said that this doctrine cannot apply to the United
States without implying those decisions respecting the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
law which I have stated; because, should it be true as is contended
that the constitutional definition of treason comprehends
him who advises or procures an assemblage that levies
war, it would not follow that such adviser or procurer might be
charged as having been present at the assemblage.</p>

<p>If the adviser or procurer be within the definition of levying
war, and independent of the agency of the common law do actually
levy war, then the advisement of procurement is an overt
act of levying war. If it be the overt action which he is to be
convicted, then it must be charged in the indictment; for he
can only be convicted on proof of the overt acts which are
charged.</p>

<p>To render this distinction more intelligible let it be recollected,
that although it should be conceded that since the statutes
of William and Mary he who advises or procures a treason
may, in England, be charged as having committed that treason
by virtue of the common law operation, which is said so far as
respects the indictment to unite the accessorial to the principal
offence and permit them to be charged as one, yet it can
never be conceded that he who commits one overt act under
the statute of Edward can be charged and convicted on proof
of another overt act.</p>

<p>If then procurement be an overt act of treason under the constitution,
no man can be convicted for the procurement under
an indictment charging him with actually assembling, whatever
may be the doctrine of the common law in the case of an
accessorial offender.<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a></p>
